== Editor

The _Editor_ page of Niord is accessible for logged in editors via the main menu.

It contains sub-pages for creating and editing NW and NM messages, for managing the lifecycle
of the messages and for submitting comments to a message.

=== Blank Editor Page ===

If the user enters the _Editor_ page directly (as opposed to clicking _Edit_ on a message),
the _Edit_ page looks similar to this:

If the current domain supports Navigational Warnings, there will be a prominent "New NW" button
for creating a new blank NW message.

Similarly, if the current domain supports Notices to Mariners, there will be a prominent
"New NM" button for creating a new blank NM message.

Depending on how the current domain has been set up administratively, there may also be a
_template execution field_. Navigational Warnings in particular often follow a very strict
template for how to write the messages so that they adhere to the standards for MSI, NAVTEX, etc.
The field thus allows the user to select and execute a template, such as "Light Unlit".
Message Templates is an extensive topic, covered in greater detail in the
<<Message Template Execution>> section.

Lastly, the blank editor page will list the draft messages that the current user has
recently edited.

=== Edit Editor Page ===

When the user has created a new NW or NM message, as described in the previous section, or if
the user clicks _Edit_ on an existing message, the user will enter the _Edit_ editor sub-page,
which is the main page for actually editing the fields of a message.
See image in the beginning of the <<Editor>> chapter.

==== General Edit Page Controls ====

If the user enters the _Edit_ editor page by clicking _Edit_ on a message in the messages list,
there will be a "Back to list" button that will return the user to the _Messages_ page with
the same message filter applied as when entering the _Edit_ page.

The "Clear" button will cancel all changes and return the user to the <<Blank Editor Page>>.

If the currently edited message has any unsaved changes, there will be a red _Save_ icon
next to the "Editor" title:

At the bottom of the page, there is a "Save Message" button and a "Reload Message" button, which
will respectively save any changes to the message and reload the message whilst discarding any changes.
