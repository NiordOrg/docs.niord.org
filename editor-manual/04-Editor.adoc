== Editor

The _Editor_ page of Niord is accessible for logged in editors via the main menu.

It contains sub-pages for creating and editing NW and NM messages, for managing the lifecycle
of the messages and for submitting comments to a message.

=== Blank Editor Page ===

If the user enters the _Editor_ page directly (as opposed to clicking _Edit_ on a message),
the _Edit_ page looks similar to this:

image::BlankEditorPage.png[Blank Editor Page, 600]

If the current domain supports Navigational Warnings, there will be a prominent "New NW" button
for creating a new blank NW message.

Similarly, if the current domain supports Notices to Mariners, there will be a prominent
"New NM" button for creating a new blank NM message.

Depending on how the current domain has been set up administratively, there may also be a
_template execution field_. Navigational Warnings in particular often follow a very strict
template for how to write the messages so that they adhere to the standards for MSI, NAVTEX, etc.
The field thus allows the user to select and execute a template, such as "Light Unlit".
Message Templates is an extensive topic, covered in greater detail in the
<<Message Template Execution>> section.

Lastly, the blank editor page will list the draft messages that the current user has
recently edited.

=== Edit Editor Page ===

When the user has created a new NW or NM message, as described in the previous section, or if
the user clicks _Edit_ on an existing message, the user will enter the _Edit_ editor sub-page,
which is the main page for actually editing the fields of a message.
See image in the beginning of the <<Editor>> chapter.

==== General Edit Page Controls ====

If the user enters the _Edit_ editor page by clicking _Edit_ on a message in the messages list,
there will be a "Back to list" button that will return the user to the _Messages_ page with
the same message filter applied as when entering the _Edit_ page.

The "Clear" button will cancel all changes and return the user to the <<Blank Editor Page>>.

If the currently edited message has any unsaved changes, there will be a red _Save_ icon
next to the "Editor" title:

At the bottom of the page, there is a "Save Message" button and a "Reload Message" button, which
will respectively save any changes to the message and reload the message whilst discarding any changes.

The rest of the _Edit_ page is dedicated to the list of field editors for all the fields
that make the message being edited.

The list of fields is configured administratively per domain and message type. As an example,
Notices to Mariners will support fields such as "original information", whereas Navigational Warnings
may have a field for editing its NAVTEX promulgation.

In order to conserve space, all editor fields are "collapsed" by default, showing a read-only
version of the field value in the currently selected language.
However, clicking at the field title will expand the field and display the field editor in full.
See example below withe the _Areas_ editor field in collapsed and expanded mode:

image::EditorFieldAreas.png[Areas Editor Field Expanded, 600]

The editor has extensive support for keyboard navigation. The user can use the arrow-up and
arrow-down key to shift focus from field title to field title. Use arrow-right to expand the
editor field currently selected, and arrow-left to collapse the field.
Use tab, respectively shift-tab, to shift focus between the input fields of a field editor.

The remainder of this section will describe the individual editor fields one by one.

==== Orig. Information Editor Field ====

The _Orig. Information_ editor field is typically only present when editing a Notice to Mariners.
The editor field contains a toggle-button that can be used to flag if the message is based on
original information or not.
