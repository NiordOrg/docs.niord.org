== Editor

The _Editor_ page of Niord is accessible for logged in editors via the main menu.

It contains sub-pages for creating and editing NW and NM messages, for managing the lifecycle
of the messages and for submitting comments to a message.

image::Editor.png[Editor, 800]


=== Blank Editor Page ===

If the user enters the _Editor_ page directly (as opposed to clicking _Edit_ on a message),
the _Edit_ page looks similar to this:

image::BlankEditorPage.png[Blank Editor Page, 600]

If the current domain supports Navigational Warnings, there will be a prominent "New NW" button
for creating a new blank NW message.

Similarly, if the current domain supports Notices to Mariners, there will be a prominent
"New NM" button for creating a new blank NM message.

Depending on how the current domain has been set up administratively, there may also be a
_template execution field_. Navigational Warnings in particular often follow a very strict
template for how to write the messages so that they adhere to the standards for MSI, NAVTEX, etc.
The field thus allows the user to select and execute a template, such as "Light Unlit".
Message Templates is an extensive topic, covered in greater detail in the
<<Message Template Execution>> section.

Lastly, the blank editor page will list the draft messages that the current user has
recently edited.

=== Edit Editor Page ===

When the user has created a new NW or NM message, as described in the previous section, or if
the user clicks _Edit_ on an existing message, the user will enter the _Edit_ editor sub-page,
which is the main page for actually editing the fields of a message.
See image in the beginning of the <<Editor>> chapter.

==== General Edit Page Controls ====

If the user enters the _Edit_ editor page by clicking _Edit_ on a message in the messages list,
there will be a "Back to list" button that will return the user to the _Messages_ page with
the same message filter applied as when entering the _Edit_ page.

The "Clear" button will cancel all changes and return the user to the <<Blank Editor Page>>.

If the currently edited message has any unsaved changes, there will be a red _Save_ icon
next to the "Editor" title:

image::EditorDirty.png[Dirty Editor Symbol, 100]

At the bottom of the page, there is a "Save Message" button and a "Reload Message" button, which
will respectively save any changes to the message and reload the message whilst discarding any changes.

The rest of the _Edit_ page is dedicated to the list of field editors for all the fields
that make the message being edited.

The list of fields is configured administratively per domain and message type. As an example,
Notices to Mariners will support fields such as "original information", whereas Navigational Warnings
may have a field for editing its NAVTEX promulgation.

In order to conserve space, all editor fields are "collapsed" by default, showing a read-only
version of the field value in the currently selected language.
However, clicking at the field title will expand the field and display the field editor in full.
See example below withe the _Areas_ editor field in collapsed and expanded mode:

image::EditorFieldAreasCollapsed.png[Areas Editor Field Collapsed, 180]
image::EditorFieldAreas.png[Areas Editor Field Expanded, 600]

The editor has extensive support for keyboard navigation. The user can use the arrow-up and
arrow-down key to shift focus from field title to field title. Use arrow-right to expand the
editor field currently selected, and arrow-left to collapse the field.
Use tab, respectively shift-tab, to shift focus between the input fields of a field editor.

The remainder of this section will describe the individual editor fields one by one.

==== Orig. Information Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldOrigInfo.png[Orig. Information Editor Field, 600]

The _Orig. Information_ editor field is typically only present when editing a Notice to Mariners.
The editor field contains a toggle-button that can be used to flag if the message is based on
original information or not.

==== Type Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldType.png[Type Editor Field, 600]

The _Type_ editor field allows the user specify the sub-type of the message.

For Navigational Warnings, the types include _Local_, _Coastal_,
_Subarea_ and _Navarea_. Depending on the system configuration of the domain, only a subset
of these types may be available.

For Notices to Mariners, the types include _Preliminary_, _Temporary_,
_Permanent_ and _Miscellaneous_. Depending on the system configuration of the domain, only a subset
of these types may be available.

==== ID Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldId.png[ID Editor Field, 600]

All messages must be associated with a _message series_, which are defined administratively for
each domain.
The message series are used to group messages and define traits such as the format of the message
_short ID_, and the numbering scheme. There are four possible types of numbering schemes:

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Numbering Scheme|Description

|yearly|Every message will automatically be assigned a number when they are published.
The number sequence starts at 1 every 1st of january.

|continuous|Every message will automatically be assigned a number when they are published.
The number sequence is never reset.

|manual|The user manually assigns a number in the _ID_ editor field.

|none|The message will not be assigned a number.

|===


The _ID_ editor field lets lets the user select any of the available message series for the
current domain and message type. Often there will only be one to select from, in which case,
it will be pre-selected.

If the numbering scheme of the selected message series is _manual_, the _ID_ editor field
will also have an input field for the user to fill out the message number.

Lastly, all messages will automatically be assigned a unique system ID, or _UID_, upon creation,
which can also be found in the _ID_ editor field.
Although the UID is not very end-user friendly, it can be used to uniquely identify messages even
before they are published.

==== Title Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldTitle.png[Title Editor Field, 600]

The _Title_ editor field allows the user to specify the main title of the message in all supported
languages.

By default, the "Auto generate" option is checked, in which case the title fields are disabled
and computed automatically, by concatenating the currently selected _areas_, _vicinity_ and
the _subject_ fields of each message parts.

==== References Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldReferences.png[References Editor Field, 600]

The _References_ editor field allows the user to manage a list of typed references from the edited
message to other messages. It is mainly used for Notices to Mariners, but could also e.g. be used
for cancellation references in navigational warnings.

Each reference must specify a _message ID_ which may either be the _short ID_ or the _UID_ of the
referenced message.

The reference type is one of _reference_, _repetition_, _repetition_with_new_time_,
_updated_repetition_, _cancelled_, and signals the nature of the relationship between the
messages.

Additionally, the user may add a reference description in all supported languages.

In end-user applications, references can e.g. be used to hyperlink between messages.

==== Publish Date Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldPublishDate.png[Publish Date Editor Field, 600]

Messages can either be scheduled for publication, or published and cancelled manually
via the <<Status Editor Page>>.

The _Publish Date_ editor field can be used for assigning a _publish from_ and/or a
_publish to_ date.
If a message has the _Verified_ status, the system will automatically publish the message when the
_publish from_ date is reached. Similarly, if the _publish to_ date is specified for a published
message, the system will automatically expire the message when that date is reached.

The user can also specify a _follow-up date_ in the _Publish Date_ editor field. The _follow up_ date
can be displayed and sorted by on the <<Messages>> page.

==== Areas Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldAreas.png[Areas Editor Field, 600]

The _Areas_ editor field can be used to assign one or more areas to a message. The areas to select
from are created and managed by administrators in a hierarchical structure - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#areas[Areas] admin chapter.

So, as an example, the firing area "EK D 371 Marstal Bugt" is a sub-area of "The Baltic Sea", which
is in turn a sub-area of "Denmark".

Selecting an area in the _Areas_ editor field will also implicitly select all parent areas.

In addition to the main area input field, the user can also specify a _vicinity_ in all supported
languages. This is used for the specific location of the hazard (such as a harbour name).

If the selected area has an associated geometry, the "Copy Locations" button will copy that
geometry into the <<Positions Editor Field>> of the message.

Alternatively, if no area has been selected but a geometry has been defined for the message, then
clicking the "Compute from Locations" will attempt to deduce the area from the geometry.

==== Categories Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldCategories.png[Categories Editor Field, 600]

The _Categories_ editor field can be used to assign one or more categories to a message.
The categories to select from are created and managed by system administrators in a
hierarchical structure.

Some categories have been defined as executable _message templates_. If one or more of these
categories have been selected, the image:ExecuteTemplateBtn.png[Tag, 16] will be enabled and
allow for execution.

Navigational Warnings in particular often follow a very strict
template for how to write the messages so that they adhere to the standards for MSI, NAVTEX, etc.
The field thus allows the user to select and execute a template, such as "Light Unlit".
Message Templates is an extensive topic, covered in greater detail in the
<<Message Template Execution>> section.

==== Message Parts ====

A message consists of a set of common _preamble_ fields and a list of _Message Parts_,
where each message part conceptually defines the time, place and description of a hazard.

The option for one message to describe multiple message parts is mostly used for Notices to Mariners,
not so much for Navigational Warnings, which typically only define a single message part.

Each message part is headed by a _message part header panel_:

image::MessagePartType.png[Message Part Type, 600]

Clicking the plus sign will add a new message part below, and clicking the minus sign will delete
the given message part. If more than one message part are present, there will also be an arrow-up and
an arrow-down button in the message part header panel, which may be used to re-arrange the message
parts.

Lastly, the message part header panel allows for the selection of a _message part type_, such as
"Details", "Time", "Positions" or "Note".
The only effect of selecting a message part type, is to hide some of the message part fields.
The type field can also be used to improve the end-user display of a message by providing
custom titles for each message part. See the example below where the first message part is labelled
"Details" and the second one is labelled "Note".

image::SampleNM.png[Multi-Message Part NM, 600]

==== Event Dates Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldEventDates.png[Event Dates Editor Field, 600]

Depending on the message part type, each message part can be assigned a list of event dates via
the _Event Dates_ editor field.

Whereas the publication date interval determines when a message is in-force,
the event dates pertain to the underlying hazard, such as a future firing exercise.

For navigational warnings, though, the event dates are typically identical to the publication date.
Hence, by default, the _Event Dates_ editor field is not displayed for NWs. If needed, the editor
field can be enabled from the _Action_ menu.

If no event dates are specified when a message is published, an event date interval is automatically
added to the first Details message part, thereby synchronizing the event date interval with the
publication date interval. This interval is updated when the message is subsequently cancelled
or expires.

The main purpose of event dates, is for clients to be able to use it in route planning, and so forth.

The event date intervals has an _all-day_ flag that can be used to switch between specifying
date-and-time or date only.

==== Positions Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldPositions.png[Positions Editor Field, 600]

Depending on the message part type, each message part can be assigned a geometrical extent
in via the _Positions_ editor field.

The positions can either be entered as text of via a graphical editor. This is detailed
further in the <<Position Editor>> chapter.

==== Subject Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldSubject.png[Subject Editor Field, 600]

Depending on the message part type, each message part can be assigned a subject, i.e. a short
title for the message part in all supported model languages, via the _Subject_ editor field.

When the full message title is auto-computed, as detailed in the <<Title Editor Field>> section,
it will be assembled by concatenating the message area, vicinity and the subjects of all message parts.

The _Hide Subject_ checkbox is used to indicate if the subject should be displayed as a heading for
each message part, when rendering the message details.
Since the subject of a message part is already likely to be part of the message title, there is often
no reason to repeat the subject in the message body.
However, if the message contains multiple message parts, it may improve the legibility, if each message
part is headed by its subject. See example below:

image::SampleNM2.png[Displaying Subjects, 600]

==== Description Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldDescription.png[Description Editor Field, 600]

Depending on the message part type, each message part can be assigned a rich-text description
in all supported model languages, via the _Description_ editor field.

Most of the editor tools are standard text editor tools for controlling e.g. the text style and
color, alignment, bullet and numbered lists, etc.

However, some of the editor tools will be detailed further below.

===== image:TextEditorToolFullScreen.png[Insert Image, 18] Fullscreen =====

Probably the single most important tool, is the _Full-Screen_ tool. It will toggle between showing
the editor in full-screen mode.

For marginally complex message descriptions, editing in the standard layout is plainly too cramped.

[id=insert-link-and-image]
===== image:TextEditorToolLinks.png[Insert Links, 18] Insert/edit Link and image:TextEditorToolImage.png[Insert Image, 18] Insert/edit Image =====

Adding links and images to the rich-text description, ties in with the attachments added to the message
via the <<Attachments Editor Field>>. If e.g. the user uploads a PDF or a photo as an attachment to the
message, the user can subsequently add links to the file in the rich-text description, or indeed, insert
the image directly in the text.

image::TextEditorToolImageDialog.png[Insert Image dialog, 300]

In the example above, the _Insert/edit image_ tool was enacted, opening the image dialog.
Click the image:TextEditorToolImageAttachment.png[Insert Image, 18] _Source_ field button
to select the attached image to insert or edit.

The same procedure applies when inserting links to attachments.

===== image:TextEditorToolTable.png[Table Tool, 18] Table =====

The _Table_ tool is fairly advanced, with lots of context-dependent functions.
When the cursor is within a table many of these will be available via a table toolbar above the table.
Even more options are available in the context menu, when right-clicking in a table. Of special
interest are the _Class_ options, which can be used to control the appearance of the table, rows and cells:

* _Table Properties_: Select between the classes "None", "No border", "condensed", "No border + condensed",
  "Positions" and "Position table", to change the layout of the entire table.
* _Row Properties_: You find the _Row Properties_ in the right-click context menu. Select between the classes
  "None" and "Underline" to change the layout of the current or the selected rows.
* _Cell Properties_: You find the _Cell Properties_ in the right-click context menu. Select between the classes
  "None", "Underline", "Position" and "Pos. Index" to change the layout of the current or the selected cells.


[id=insert-locations]
===== image:TextEditorToolLocations.png[Insert Locations Tool, 18] Insert Locations =====

The _Insert Locations_ tool is a very useful tool that may be used to format and insert
the positions defined in the <<Positions Editor Field>> in the rich text description.
The generated text will adhere to the language of the description field.

Clicking the _Insert Locations_ tool will open the _Format Message Locations_ dialog:

image::TextEditorToolLocationDialog.png[Format Message Locations Dialog, 600]

The _Features_ panel allows the user to select which geographical feature to insert. Message positions
are defined via geometrical features such as points, polygons, line-strings, etc, each of which will
define a list of positions. The position list only contain the positions that makes sense in a textual
description. So for instance, if the geometrical feature is a polygon with holes in, only the
positions of the exterior ring is included.

The _Layout_ panel is used to select a layout template used for rendering the positions, that is, if the
list of positions should be rendered in a table, a bullet list or as text.
The user may also select the position format, such as "NAVTEX", "Seconds" or various "Decimal" formats.

The _Result_ panel will preview the result.

[id=insert-time]
===== image:TextEditorToolTime.png[Insert Time Tool, 18] Insert Time =====

The _Insert Time_ tool may be used to format and insert the event time intervals defined in
the <<Event Dates Editor Field>> in the rich text description. The generated text will adhere to the
language of the description field.

Clicking the _Insert Time_ tool will open the _Format Message Time_ dialog:

image::TextEditorToolTimeDialog.png[Format Message Time Dialog, 400]

The _Time Intervals_ panel allows the user to select which of the event date intervals to format and insert.

The _Layout_ panel let the user select whether or not to include the time-zone in the formatted text.

The _Result_ panel will preview the result.

==== Attachments Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldAttachments.png[Attachments Editor Field, 600]

The _Attachments Editor Field_ can be used to associate files, such as PDFs and photos, with a message.

If a message has an associated list of attachments, the attachments can be viewed and downloaded
by end-users when viewing the message details. See example below:

image::SampleNM3.png[Message Attachments, 600]

Attachments can also be linked or inserted directly in the rich-text description field of a message part,
as described in the <<insert-link-and-image>> sub-section.

A new file is attached to a message by clicking the "Browse..." button and selecting the file, or by
dragging the file into the dotted-line panel surrounding the "Browse..." button.

An existing attachment can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to the attachment.

An additional caption can also be specified for attachments in all supported model languages.

For embeddable attachments, such as images and videos, an extra _Display_ option will be available:

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Display Value|Description

| Above Message
| If the _Above Message_ option is selected, the attachment (i.e. image or video) will be displayed
  above the message when rendering the message details, or generating a print report.

| Below Message
| If the _Below Message_ option is selected, the attachment (i.e. image or video) will be displayed
  below the message when rendering the message details, or generating a print report.

| Separate Page
| If the _Separate Page_ option is selected, the attachment (i.e. image or video) will be displayed
  on a separate page when generating a print report.

|===

If either of the display options above is selected, the size of the embedded attachment can be
specified in the _Width_ and _Height_ field. If only one of these fields is filled out, the
embedded attachment will be scaled proportionally.

As part of the _Width_ or _Height_ values, the user must also specify the unit, which must be one of
"em", "px", "%", "cm", "mm", "in", "pt" or "pc".

==== Charts Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldCharts.png[Charts Editor Field, 600]

The _Charts_ editor field can be used to assign one or more nautical charts to a message.
The charts to select from are created and managed by administrators - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#charts[Charts] admin chapter.

If the "Sort" button is clicked, the current selection of charts will be sorted according to their scale.

If the "Compute from Locations" button is clicked, the charts field will be instantiated with the
sorted list of all nautical charts whose geographical extent overlaps with the positions defined
for the message will be included.
This list should subsequently be verified by the user, since some of the charts may not actually
contain the feature (say, a light) referenced by the message.

The _Horizontal Datum_ field can be used to specify the horizontal datum, typically WGS84.
The horizontal datum is not currently used anywhere in Niord.

==== Publication Editor Field ====

image::EditorFieldPublication.png[Publication Editor Field, 600]

The _Publication_ editor field is used to list the publications relevant to the message, such as
the List of Lights, Aids to Navigation, the journal number for an associated case in a content
management system, etc.

The publications are maintained in rich-text editor fields, mainly to facilitate hyperlinks to the
referenced publications.
There is one set of _internal publication_ and one set of _external publication_ fields for each
supported model language.
Only the external publications will be displayed to end-users, whereas internal publications
will be viewable to registered users of Niord as well.

The user can use the image:TextEditorToolPublication.png[Insert Publication, 18] tool to insert
one of the publications created and managed by administrators in Niord - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#publications[Publications] admin chapter.

When the _Insert Publication_ tool is clicked, a dialog pops up that allows the user to add or edit
a pre-defined publication:

image::MessagePublications.png[Message Publications, 600]

Some publications will display a parameter input field, where the user can specify additional parameters.
This is typically used to e.g. specify relevant light numbers for the List of Light publication, etc.

The user can choose to update only the publication field where the _Insert Publication_ tool was clicked,
or update all language versions.
