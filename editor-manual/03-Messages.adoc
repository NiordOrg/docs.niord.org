== Messages

The _Messages_ page of Niord is always accessible via the main menu. It lists the NW and NM
messages of the system according to the selected filter criteria, sorting and view mode.

image::Messages.png[Messages, 600]

=== View Modes

The current selection of messages can be displayed in four different view modes:
_Table_, _Grid_, _Details_ and _Map_, any of which may be selected in the
Messages sub-menu.

image::ViewModes.png[Messages, 300]

==== Table View Mode

The default view mode is the _Table_ view mode, where the filtered list of messages is
presented in a compact table-like list. See example above.

The user can easily sort the message list by either message ID, date or area by clicking
the respective column name in the header row. Click the same header name to toggle
between ascending and descending sort order.

The date column can either display the publish dates, the event dates or the follow-up dates
of the messages. Click the ellipsis in the header menu to switch between the date types.

==== Grid View Mode

When selecting the _Grid_ view mode, messages are listed in a semi-compact fashion with an
auto-generated thumbnail image for each message.

image::GridViewMode.png[Grid View Mode, 600]

==== Details View Mode

In the the _Details_ view mode, each message is listed in detail, similarly to when
a message is displayed in the <<Message Details>> dialog.

image::DetailsViewMode.png[Details View Mode, 600]

==== Map View Mode

In the _Map_ view mode, all messages are displayed in a map. The list of messages will always be
filtered according to the current bounding box of the map.

There is a _Search Result_ panel in the top-left part of the map which contains a compact textual listing
of the current set of messages.
By default, this panel is collapsed, but the user may click the toggle-expand/collapse button in the
panel header to show/hide the message list.

image::MapViewMode.png[Map View Mode, 600]


=== Message Selection

Irrespective of the view mode, each message of a messages list can be _selected_ by clicking
the image:SelectionButton.png[Selection, 20] selection icon. And de-selected by clicking the icon again.

The current message selection is available at the _Selection_ sub-page:

image::MessageSelection.png[Message Selection, 600]

The selection list is persistent throughout the browser session, in the sense that you can
perform multiple message searches, and thus build up the selection list as appropriate.

The purpose of supporting message selection, is to be able to perform certain actions on a
more specific set of messages than those matching the current filtering criteria.
Actions that can be applied to a selected set of messages include printing PDF reports,
sending e-mails with messages, assigning messages to (and removing from) message tags, etc.
These actions are detailed in the <<Message Actions>> section.

=== Message Filtering

When a user first enters the _Messages_ page, the default set of messages being displayed consists
of all published (in-force) messages associated with the currently selected domain.

The way to search for other types of messages is by applying a combination of message filters,
available from the _Filter_ menu:

image::MessageFiltering.png[Message Filtering, 600]

Whenever a message filter is updated, the resulting list of messages will automatically be updated,
and also, the address (URL) of the browser will be updated, so that you can in effect bookmark a specific
message filter.

The filters will be detailed individually below.

==== Domain Filter ====

image::MessageFilterDomain.png[Domain Filter, 240]

The _Domain_ filter allows the user to search messages of another domain without switching the current
domain selection. This is very useful, if you e.g. wish to base a new Notice to Mariner on a copy of
an existing Navigational Warning.

As an important security constraint, when filtering on messages from a different domain only
public messages will be included in the search result.
Public messages are those whose status are either _Published_, _Cancelled_ or _Expired_.

==== Message Series Filter ====

image::MessageFilterSeries.png[Mesage Series, 400]

The messages of a domain will always be associated with a _message series_ of that domain, which e.g.
defines the message ID naming and numbering scheme, etc. As an example, an "NW" domain might
have separate message series for local and coastal navigational warnings.

When applying the _Message Series_ filter, the user gets to select which message series of the current
domain to show messages for.

If a domain filter has been applied, as described in the previous section, the user can filter by the
message series of that domain instead.

==== Text Filter ====

image::MessageFilterText.png[Text, 400]

The _Text_ allows the user to filter across all textual contents of a message, i.e. message title,
details, areas, categories, charts, ID, etc.

The text filter supports a Google-like syntax, as described below:

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Type|Description

|"light buoy"|Use quotes to filter on exact sentence matches.

|+light -buoy|Use + for terms that must be included and - for terms that must be excluded.

|Københa*|Use * for partial term matches.
|===

==== Type Filter ====

image::MessageFilterType.png[Type, 400]

The _Type_ filter allows the user to filter on one or more message types.

If the current domain supports Navigational Warnings, the types include _Local_, _Coastal_,
_Subarea_ and _Navarea_. Depending on the system configuration of the domain, only a subset
of these types may be available.

If the current domain supports Notices to Mariners, the types include _Preliminary_, _Temporary_,
_Permanent_ and _Miscellaneous_. Depending on the system configuration of the domain, only a subset
of these types may be available.

==== Status Filter ====

image::MessageFilterStatus.png[Status, 400]

By default, the _Messages_ page will display all published (in-force) messages of the current domain.
The _Status_ filter allows the user to select any combination of statuses to filter on.

As an important security constraint, only users with the _editor_ (or _admin_ or _sysadmin_) role
can filter on all statuses.

Users with a _User_ role, or indeed, users that have not logged in, can only filter on public statuses,
defined as either _Published_, _Cancelled_ or _Expired_.

==== Tag Filter ====

image::MessageFilterTag.png[Tag, 400]

_Message Tags_ plays an important role in Niord, as they may be used to persistently group
sets of messages. A more detailed description can be found in the <<Message Tags>> section.

The _Tags_ filter can be used to filter the search result to messages belonging to on one or more message tags.
Clicking the image:TagButton.png[Tag, 20] button will open the Message Tag dialog,
for easy selection of message tags.

==== Publication Filter ====

image::MessageFilterPublication.png[Publication, 400]

Niord allows administrators to define _publications_ such as weekly Notices to Mariners digests.
These publications are based on lists of messages. The _Publication_ filter thus allows the user
to filter on messages belonging to one or more publications.

==== User Filter ====

image::MessageFilterUser.png[User, 400]

The _User_ filter allows the user to filter messages on any of the registered users in Niord, and
whether the selected user originally created a message, has ever updated a message, or indeed, is the
last person to edit the message.

==== Comments Filter ====

image::MessageFilterComments.png[Comments, 400]

The process of composing a new NW or NM message often involves multiple users that write up the message
and proof-read it. To aid this process, users may submit new _comments_ to a message,
and acknowledge existing comments.

The _Comments_ filter allows the user to filter on messages with different types of comments, such as
comments that the user has submitted, unacknowledged comments, and unacknowledged comments by the current user.

==== Reference Filter ====

image::MessageFilterReference.png[Reference, 400]

A message may be associated with a list of _references_ to other messages. The references are typed to
indicate if the message e.g. represents a "cancellation" of the referenced message, an "updated repetition",
and so forth.

The _Reference_ filter allows the user to search messages by reference hierarchies. The filter consists of
a _message ID_ field and a numeric _Level_ field.

The message specified by the message ID will be the base message of the filter. With a level set to "0"
only that particular message will be in the search result.

If the level is "1", all messages directly referencing the base message or directly referenced from the base
message will be included.

If the level is "2", all messages referencing any of the level "1" messages or referenced from any of
the level "1" messages will be included.

And so forth...

==== Chart Filter ====

image::MessageFilterChart.png[Chart, 400]

The _Chart_ filter allows the user to filter on messages that are associated with any of a list
of sea charts.

==== Area Filter ====

image::MessageFilterArea.png[Area, 400]

Areas are defined in a hierarchical tree by administrators.

The _Area_ filter allows the user to filter on messages that are associated with any of a list
of areas including sub-areas of the selected areas.

==== Category Filter ====

image::MessageFilterCategory.png[Category, 400]

Categories are defined in a hierarchical tree by administrators.

The _Category_ filter allows the user to filter on messages that are associated with any of a list
of categories including sub-categories of the selected categories.

==== Date Filter ====

image::MessageFilterDate.png[Date, 400]

The _Date_ filter allows the user to filter on date ranges.
The date type menu has the following options:

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Date Type|Description

|Publish Date|The publish date interval of a message must overlap the specified date interval.

|Publish From|The message must have been published within the specified date interval.

|Event Dates|The event date intervals of a message must overlap the specified date interval.

|Created Date|The message must have been created within the specified date interval.

|Last Updated Date|The message must have been last updated within the specified date interval.

|===

==== Clear Filter ====

The _Clear Filter_ function of the _Filter_ menu will clear any current filter.


==== Save Filter ====

The _Save Filter_ function of the _Filter_ menu will allow the user to save often-used filter
combinations.

These saved filters will appear at the top of the _Filter_ menu for easy access.


=== Message Actions

The _Action_ menu lists the operations that can be performed on the current list of messages, or the
current selection of messages.

The number of actions present in the menu depends on whether any messages are currently selected, and
whether the user is an editor or administrator.

image::MessageActions.png[Message Actions, 600]

The actions will be detailed individually below.


==== Print Action ====

image::PrintDialog.png[Print Dialog, 300]

Enacting "Print..." will print the current message list. The print dialog allows
the user to adjust page size and direction.

More importantly, it allows the user to select a print report from the _Report_ menu.
The set of available reports and their design is configured by a system administrator
on a per-domain basis.

All domains include a "Standard" and a "Draft" report. The "Standard" report will print all
details of the messages. The "Draft" report will print all language variants of all
messages including additional fields, that makes the report useful for e.g. proof
reading messages.

Additionally, a domain for Notices to Mariners will typically include reports for
printing the NM list as a weekly NM digest, and a report for printing the
active T&P messages.

==== Print Selection Action ====

Similar to the <<Print Action>>, except that only the current selection of messages get printed.

==== E-mail Selection Action ====

image::MailDialog.png[Email Dialog, 400]

The _E-mail Selection_ action is only available when one or more messages have been selected.
A dialog will prompt the user to fill out the recipient, email subject and an optional message
to the recipients.

When clicking _Send Mail_, a mail is constructed and sent along, that contains the details
of the currently selected messages.

The function can be useful when e.g. following up on the work described in a Notice to Mariner.

==== Add Selection to Tag Action ====

The _Add Selection to Tag_ action is only available when one or more messages have been selected.

It will open the Message Tag Dialog and allow the user to select a message tag the
currently selected messages should be added to.

Message Tags are described in detail in the <<Message Tags>> section.

==== Remove Selection from Tag Action ====

The _Remove Selection from Tag_ action is only available when one or more messages have been selected.

It will open the Message Tag Dialog and allow the user to select a message tag the
currently selected messages should be removed from.

Message Tags are described in detail in the <<Message Tags>> section.

==== Select All Action ====

Will select all messages in the message list. Please refer to the <<Message Selection>> section.

==== Clear Selection Action ====

Will clear the current message selection. Please refer to the <<Message Selection>> section.

==== Compare Action ====

image::ComparisonDialog.png[Message Comparison Dialog, 600]

The _Compare_ action is only available when precisely two messages have been selected.

The _Message 1_ and _Message 2_ fields allows the user to specify the ID of the two messages
to compare. The ID may either be the _short ID_ of the message (e.g. "NM-077-16") or
the UID of the message (a system-specific UID that all messages have,
even unpublished messages).

Next, the user may toggle between which language variant to compare.

By default, the details of the two selected messages are displayed side-by-side (see above).
Alternatively, the user can choose to display the textual changes between the messages:

image::ComparisonDialogChanges.png[Message Comparison Changes, 500]

Colour-coding is used to flag additions (green) a deletions (red) between the two messages.

Lastly, the use can choose to inspect the changes of the underlying message data:

image::ComparisonDialogData.png[Message Comparison Data, 500]

The data-comparison function is somewhat specialized, but also incredible useful, and
targeted advanced users. Color coding is again applied to flag changed data (yellow),
added data (green) and removed data (red) between the two messages.

==== Export Action ====

Enacting the _Export_ action, will export the current message list as a zip-archive.
The exported zip-archive has a format that is compatible with the _Import_ function
which is only available to administrators.

The exported data will include any files attached to the messages (used primarily by
Notices to Mariners).

==== Export Selection Action ====

The _Export Selection_ action is analogous to the <<Export Action>> except that
it only exports the currently selected list of messages.

==== Import Action ====

image::ImportDialog.png[Message Import Dialog, 400]

The _Import_ action is only available to administrators, as it is quite advanced and disruptive.
It imports a zip-archive, as generated by the <<Export Action>>.

The Import dialog options allows the administrator to adjust the behaviour of the import.

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Setting|Description

|UID Handling | Either choose to assign new UIDs to the imported messages or preserve the UID of
the imported messages, but ignore messages that have UIDs that already exist in the system.

|Status Handling | Either force all imported messages to have a _Draft_ status, or preserve
their exported status.

|Base Data Handling | If the imported messages reference base data (e.g. areas, categories or
sea charts) that does not exist in the system, either create the base data, or ignore it.

|Message Series Handling | Either choose to preserve the message series of an imported message
(if it is valid for the current domain), or force imported messages to use the
specified message series.

|Tag | If a message tag is specified, all imported messages will be assigned to it.

|===

==== Update Selection Status Action ====

image::StatusUpdateDialog.png[Status Update Dialog, 600]

The _Update Selection Status_ action is only available to administrators, and only if one or more
messages have been selected.

The operation allows the administrator to perform bulk-updates of message statuses, that
you can normally only perform message-by-message on the Editor Status page.

For all the selected messages, there is a _New Status_ menu where the administrator can select
any of the valid status transitions.

All status changes are applied when the "Save Changes" button is clicked.

==== Sort Area Action ====

image::SortMessagesDialog.png[Sort Messages by Area Dialog, 600]

The _Sort Area_ action allows the user to perform fine-grained persistent sorting
of the messages of a certain area.

An alternative way of accessing the _Sort Area_ dialog is by clicking the "Sort..." link
next to the area name in the message list (when the messages area sorted by area):

image::SortAreaLink.png[Sort Messages by Area Link, 300]

The sorting of messages by area is a fairly advanced topic. By default, messages adheres to
the sorting of the area tree, as defined by an administrator:

image::AreaTree.png[Sample Area Tree, 200, float=left]

In this example, "Denmark" is sorted before "Faroe Islands", and within "Denmark", "The Baltic Sea"
is sorted before "The Sound", etc.

However, it is possible to adjust this sorting administratively. So, for instance, all messages
associated with "The Baltic Sea" or any of its sub-areas will be sorted clockwise around
the position 54° 30'N - 012° 00'E starting at a bearing of 180°.

Similarly, all messages associated with "The Sound" or any of its sub-areas will be
sorted North-to-South.

And so forth...

This automated sorting of messages by area can then be overridden manually by using
the _Sort Area_ action.
Once an area has been selected, all the messages of the area can be re-arranged by dragging a
message to its proper position using the image:DragHandle.png[Drag Handle, 20] drag handle.

==== Message List Sort Selection ====

The last four items of the _Action_ menu let the user select which message field to sort by.
This include: _Area_, _ID_, _Event Dates_, _Publish Date_ and _Follow-up Date_.

Choosing the same sort field multiple times, will toggle between ascending and descending order.

A small arrow will indicate the current sort field and whether ascending or descending order
is used.

=== Message Details ===

image::MessageDetailsDialog.png[Message Details Dialog, 600]

Messages on the _Messages_ page can be inspected in the _Message Details Dialog_.

Depending on the current view mode, the user clicks the message title, the message thumbnail icon,
or the message map symbol to open the details dialog.

In the top of the details dialog, the user can inspect the message positions and areas on a map.
Below that, the textual details of the message is presented.
Bottommost, a row of buttons allows the user to navigate the previous/next message in the list,
to select or de-select the message, and an action menu with message-specific actions.

If the user clicks on a referenced message in the message details, the clicked message will be
presented instead, and the previous/next navigation buttons will change to a "Back" history button.

The _Action_ menu will contain _Edit_ and _Copy_ actions, along with some of the actions detailed
in the _Message Actions_ section that are message specific.

=== Message Tags ===

image::MessageTagsDialog.png[Message Tags Dialog, 600]

_Message Tags_ plays an important role in Niord, as they may be used to persistently group
and name sets of messages.

The _Message Tags_ are used many places, such as in the <<Tag Filter>>, the <<Import Action>> and
the Publications maintained by administrators.
Everywhere tags can be selected, the user may click the image:TagButton.png[Tag, 20]
button to open the Message Tag dialog.

Message tags can be either _Private_, _Domain_-specific or _Public_. The _Private_ tags
can only be managed and used by the user that created them, the _Domain_ tags can be
maintained and used within the domain they belong to, and the _Public_ tags are available
to all domains.

Tags can also be time-limited. When the user creates a new tag, she can specify an expiry
date of the tag, after which, the tag (but not the associated messages) will be deleted
automatically.

Furthermore, a message tag can be locked or unlocked.
As an example, the message tag used to group the NM messages of a weekly
Notices to Mariners publication, should not be modified once the the digest has been published.
Hence, editors should not be allowed to add or remove messages to and from the message tag.
And this will be prevented by locking the message tag.
Only administrators can unlock a locked message tag.
