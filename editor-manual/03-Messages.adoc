The default view mode is the _Table_ view mode, where the filtered list of messages is
presented in a compact table-like list. See example above.

The user can easily sort the message list by either message ID, date or area by clicking
the respective column name in the header row. Click the same header name to toggle
between ascending and descending sort order.

The date column can either display the publish dates, the event dates or the follow-up dates
of the messages. Click the ellipsis in the header menu to switch between the date types.

By default, this panel is collapsed, but the user may click the toggle-expand/collapse button in the
panel header to show/hide the message list.
