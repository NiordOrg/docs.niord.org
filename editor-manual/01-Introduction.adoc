== Introduction

Niord (Nautical Information Directory) is a system for producing and publishing
Navigational Warnings (_NW_) and Notices to Mariners T&P (_NM_).

It was originally developed as part of the http://efficiensea2.org[EfficienSea2] EU project
and subsequently implemented as a production system for the
http://www.dma.dk/[Danish Maritime Authority].

Some of the main features of Niord area:

* Niord provides an advanced and highly customizable production system for NW and NM T&P.
* It includes a plug-in architecture for NW and NM message promulgation via e.g. mailing lists
  and Twitter.
* Niord also integrates with the http://maritimecloud.net[Maritime Cloud] by defining a
  Maritime Cloud Service Specification and making NW & NM messages accessible via a
  link:../public-api/api.html[Public REST API]
* The link:../public-model/model.html[combined NW & NM message model] adopted by Niord has
  been devised to make data future-compatible with the upcoming IHO S-124 specification.

== Editors Manual

A user in Niord always works in the context of a _current domain_.
Domains are used to separate NW & NM messages into more manageable lists -
you could e.g. have a domain for NW messages, a domain for NM messages, a domain
for firing exercises (also NWs), or indeed domains for separate regions with
separate time-zones, etc.

A user has separate roles in each domain. The available roles are:

* _User_: The _user_ role can be assigned to e.g. case officers that should have access
  to see, proof-read and comment on un-published NW and NM messages.
* _Editor_: Editors compose and manage the life cycle of an NW or NM message.
* _Admin_: An administrator of a domain will have additional access to e.g. manage the base data
  (sea charts, publications, etc.) of the Niord system.
* _Sysadmin_: A very special role that should be held only by the person(s) actually setting
  up and managing the Niord system.

The roles listed above are hierarchical in the sense that a _sysadmin_ can do anything an _admin_
can do, who in turn can do anything an _editor_ can do, and so forth.

This document serves as a user manual for _editors_ of a domain.

CAUTION: Please use a newish Chrome, Safari or Firefox browser when using Niord.
