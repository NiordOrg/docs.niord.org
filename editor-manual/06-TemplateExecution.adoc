== Message Template Execution ==

image::TemplateExecution.png[Template Execution, 800]

The _Message Template Execution_ feature is set up and configured per domain by a system administrator.

The overarching idea is to allow the user to select and execute a message template for a specific
hazard, such as "Light Unlit".
The user will be asked to fill out a few standard template-specific parameters, and then a message
will be composed and opened in the <<Edit Editor Page>> with most of its fields filled out in
a standardized manner.

This mechanism is particularly suitable for generating Navigational Warnings, since they are mostly
short and concise, and follow very strict guidelines for how to formulate the messages so as to
adhere to the standards for MSI, NAVTEX, etc.

Notices to Mariners are much less suitable, since they are often longer, more varied and written in
a more free prose.

A _Message Template_ is actually just another name for a _category_ that can be executed as described
above.
_Categories_ are assigned to a message in the editor, as described in the <<Categories Editor Field>>
section, and they are created and managed by system administrators. Please refer to the System
Administrator Manual.

=== Template Selection Dialog

The most direct way to commence executing a message template, however, is from the
template field of the <<Blank Editor Page>> (in domains that support template execution):

If the user knows in advanced which template to execute, she can type it directly into the field.

If the user does not know in advance which template to execute, she can click the
image:TemplateSelectionBtn.png[Template Selection, 18] selection button
in the template field, thereby opening the _Template Selection Dialog_:

The main panel, "Categories", in the left side of the dialog, lists all available
executable categories (templates).
The user can select one or more of the categories in this list, and click the "Add Selected"
button below to add these to the "Selected Categories" panel in the right side of the dialog.

For many of the categories, an example message will be displayed in the bottom-right side of the
dialog to assist the user.

Most often, only a single template will be executed, but it is actually possible to execute multiple
template at once, which will produce a message with one message part per templates.

Above the "Categories" panel, there are a couple of fields to filter the available set of categories.
A "Name" input field that may be used to filter categories by name, and a "Parent Category" field
that will restrict the categories to a specific parent category (e.g. "Buoy").

Once the selection is complete, the user can either click "OK" and return to the _Blank Editor Page_
with the updated template selection, or the user may progress directly to the actual template
execution, by clicking the "Execute Template" button or tab.

=== Template Execution Dialog

As mentioned above, the user can enter the _Template Execution Dialog_ directly from the
_Template Selection Dialog_. Alternatively, the user can click the
image:TemplateExecutionBtn.png[Template Execution, 18] execution button
in the template field.

The dialog is divided into three main sections: The general template parameter panels and the
template-specific parameter panels, both at the left side of the dialog, and the preview panel
at the right side of the dialog.

The user must first fill out the parameters, typically in a top-to-bottom fashion, in the
parameter panels. At any point of time, the user may click the "Refresh Preview" button to
actually execute the template, and inspect the result in the preview panel in all supported languages.

When the user is satisfied with the result, she can click "OK", upon which, the generated message
will be opened in the <<Edit Editor Page>> - still unsaved.
Here, the user should polish the remaining fields and eventually save the message as a new draft.
