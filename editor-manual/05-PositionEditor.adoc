=== Position Editor ===

image::PositionEditor.png[Position Editor, 800]

The _Position Editor_ is used for editing the geographical extent of various entities in Niord.
Most prominently, the _Position Editor_ is used to define the geographical extent of message parts
- please refer to the <<Positions Editor Field>> section.

However, the position editor is also used by administrative users to define the geographical extent
of e.g. charts and areas - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html[User Manual for Admins].

==== GeoJSON ====

Internally, Niord has adopted the GeoJSON format for position lists and geographical extents.
Please refer to http://docs.niord.org/model/model.html#niord-geojson-model[use of GeoJSON in Niord]
for more information.

The following geometry types are supported in the Niord _Position Editor_

[cols="20,80",options="header"]
|===
|Geometry Type|Description

| Point
| A single longitude-latitude position

| MultiPoint
| A list Points

| LineString
| A connected list of longitude-latitude positions

| MultiLineString
| A list of LineStrings

| Polygon
| A polygon consists of an exterior ring, plus an optional list of interior rings that represents
  holes in the exterior ring.

| MultiPolygon
| A list of Polygons

| GeometryCollection
| A list of any of the geometry types described above.

| Feature
| A feature encapsulates one of the geometry types listed above, plus some extra attributes such as
  _properties_ object. The _properties_ object is used by Niord to store various auxiliary information,
  such as feature names, restriction flags, etc.

| FeatureCollection
| A list of Features. This is in fact the geometry type that all message parts are associated with.

|===

Of all these geometry types, the user will usually only deal with _Points_, _LineStrings_ and
_Polygons_.

==== Text Editor ====

image::PositionTextEditor.png[Position Text Editor, 600]

For relatively simple geometries, the user may choose to use the Text-based _Position Editor_
(by clicking the "Edit as Text" button).
The textual editor is also quite useful if the user wants to create a geometry based on a position list
copied from a different source, such as an e-mail.

The main format of the textual representation is:

[source,text]
----
<<Feature 1 Geometry Type>>, <<Feature Name>>
<<Feature 1, Coordinate #1>>, <<Coordinate Name>>
...
<<Feature 1, Coordinate #X>>, <<Coordinate Name>>

<<Feature 2, Geometry Type>>, <<Feature Name>>
<<Feature 2, Coordinate #1>>, <<Coordinate Name>>
...
<<Feature 2, Coordinate #Y>>, <<Coordinate Name>>

...
----

So, each feature starts with a header line stating the geometry type (_Point_, _LineString_, etc).
Next, there will be a new line for each coordinate of the geometry.
If there are multiple features, each feature must be separated with one or more blank lines.

The feature names and coordinate names are optional, but may be useful when displayed as a label on
a map. For instance, if the feature is a polygon that represents a restricted area, then it may
be useful to display the buoy types that span the area on the map.
The feature or coordinate names are defined by prefixing the name with a two-letter language code, e.g.
"en: yellow spar bouy with topmark., da: gul stage med krydstopbetegnelse."

===== Examples

Create a simple point by simply typing a latitude-longitude position on a separate line. When
no geometry type is specified, and only a single position, then it is assumed to be a _Point_:

[source,text]
----
56N 11 30.23E
----


Create a named polygon plus a line-string with named coordinates:

[source,text]
----
Polygon, da: ES D 139 Bornholm Ø., en: ES D 139 Bornholm E.
54° 54.967'N 015° 49.961'E
54° 54.969'N 015° 15.029'E
55° 03.006'N 015° 15.029'E
55° 19.930'N 015° 49.942'E
54° 54.967'N 015° 49.961'E

LineString
1) 54° 53.397'N 009° 53.071'E, da: kyst, en: coast
2) 54° 53.982'N 009° 52.170'E, da: kyst, en: coast
