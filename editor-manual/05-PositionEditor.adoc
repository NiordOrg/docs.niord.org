The _Position Editor_ is used for editing the geographical extent of various entities in Niord.
Most prominently, the _Position Editor_ is used to define the geographical extent of message parts
in the message editor - please refer to the <<Positions Editor Field>> section.

However, the position editor is also used by administrative users to defined the geographical extent
of e.g. charts and areas - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html[User Manual for Admins].

==== GeoJSON ====

Internally, Niord has adopted a GeoJSON representation for position lists and geographical extents.
Please refer to http://docs.niord.org/model/model.html#niord-geojson-model[use of GeoJSON in Niord]
for more information.
