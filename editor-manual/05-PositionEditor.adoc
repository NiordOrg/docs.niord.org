== Position Editor ==

image::PositionEditor.png[Position Editor, 800]

The _Position Editor_ is used for editing the geographical extent of various entities in Niord.
Most prominently, the _Position Editor_ is used to define the geographical extent of message parts
- please refer to the <<Positions Editor Field>> section.

However, the position editor is also used by administrative users to define the geographical extent
of e.g. charts and areas - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html[User Manual for Admins].

=== GeoJSON ===

Internally, Niord has adopted the GeoJSON format for position lists and geographical extents.
Please refer to http://docs.niord.org/model/model.html#niord-geojson-model[use of GeoJSON in Niord]
for more information.

The following geometry types are supported in the Niord _Position Editor_

[cols="20,80",options="header"]
|===
|Geometry Type|Description

| Point
| A single longitude-latitude position

| MultiPoint
| A list Points

| LineString
| A connected list of longitude-latitude positions

| MultiLineString
| A list of LineStrings

| Polygon
| A polygon consists of an exterior ring, plus an optional list of interior rings that represents
  holes in the exterior ring.

| MultiPolygon
| A list of Polygons

| GeometryCollection
| A list of any of the geometry types described above.

| Feature
| A feature encapsulates one of the geometry types listed above, plus some extra attributes such as
  _properties_ object. The _properties_ object is used by Niord to store various auxiliary information,
  such as feature names, restriction flags, etc.

| FeatureCollection
| A list of Features. This is in fact the geometry type that all message parts are associated with.

|===

Of all these geometry types, the user will usually only deal with _Points_, _LineStrings_ and
_Polygons_.

=== Text Editor ===

image::PositionTextEditor.png[Position Text Editor, 600]

For relatively simple geometries, the user may choose to use the Text-based _Position Editor_
(by clicking the "Edit as Text" button).
The textual editor is also quite useful if the user wants to create a geometry based on a position list
copied from a different source, such as an e-mail.

The main format of the textual representation is:

[source,text]
----
<<Feature 1 Geometry Type>>, <<Feature Name>>
<<Feature 1, Coordinate #1>>, <<Coordinate Name>>
...
<<Feature 1, Coordinate #X>>, <<Coordinate Name>>

<<Feature 2, Geometry Type>>, <<Feature Name>>
<<Feature 2, Coordinate #1>>, <<Coordinate Name>>
...
<<Feature 2, Coordinate #Y>>, <<Coordinate Name>>

...
----

So, each feature starts with a header line stating the geometry type (_Point_, _LineString_, etc).
Next, there will be a new line for each coordinate of the geometry.
If there are multiple features, each feature must be separated with one or more blank lines.

The feature names and coordinate names are optional, but may be useful when displayed as a label on
a map. For instance, if the feature is a polygon that represents a restricted area, then it may
be useful to display the buoy types that span the area on the map.
The feature or coordinate names are defined by prefixing the name with a two-letter language code, e.g.
"en: yellow spar bouy with topmark., da: gul stage med krydstopbetegnelse."

==== Examples

Create a simple point by simply typing a latitude-longitude position on a separate line. When
no geometry type is specified, and only a single position defined, then it is assumed to
be a _Point_:

[source,text]
----
56N 11 30.23E
----


Create a named polygon plus a line-string with named coordinates (the rather elaborate format
of the positions in this example, is there to illustrate the flexibility of the text editor):

[source,text]
----
Polygon, da: ES D 139 Bornholm Ø., en: ES D 139 Bornholm E.
54° 54.967'N 015° 49.961'E
54° 54.969'N 015° 15.029'E
55° 03.006'N 015° 15.029'E
55° 19.930'N 015° 49.942'E
54° 54.967'N 015° 49.961'E

LineString
1) 54° 53.397'N 009° 53.071'E, da: kyst, en: coast
2) 54° 53.982'N 009° 52.170'E, da: kyst, en: coast

=== Graphical Editor ===

image::PositionGraphicalEditor.png[Position Graphical Editor, 600]

In order to create and manipulate more advanced geometries, than can feasibly be handled by the
text editor described above, the user may use the _Graphical Position Editor_
(by clicking the "Edit" button).

==== Graphical Editor Tools ====

The topmost row of tools are used for drawing and manipulating features directly on the map.
The tools are detailed below.

No matter which tool is selected, the user can always pan the map by clicking and dragging directly
on the map.

===== image:PositionEditorPointTool.png[Point Tool, 18] Point Tool

When the _Point Tool_ is selected, a new single-point position will be inserted every
time the user clicks on the map.

===== image:PositionEditorPathTool.png[Path Tool, 18] Path Tool

When the _Path Tool_ is selected, a new _LineString_ path will be inserted when the
user clicks the map. The first click will place the first position of the path. Subsequent
clicks will add a new segment to the path.
The user must double-click at the map to place the last segment of the path.

===== image:PositionEditorPolygonTool.png[Polygon Tool, 18] Polygon Tool

When the _Polygon Tool_ is selected, a new _Polygon_ will be inserted when the
user clicks the map. The first click will place the first position of the polygon. Subsequent
clicks will add a new segment to the polygon.
The user must double-click at the map to place the last vertex and complete the polygon.

===== image:PositionEditorModifyTool.png[Modify Tool, 18] Modify Tool

When the _Modify Tool_ is selected, the user can select and manipulate existing features directly
in the map.

A single click directly on a feature will select the feature. If the shift key is pressed, the
feature will be added to an existing selection.

If the user keeps the shift key pressed and drags the mouse, all features within the bounding box will
be selected.

Otherwise, if the user clicks and drags the mouse on top of a feature, the feature will be moved.

If the user clicks a segment of a selected LineString, or the border of a selected Polygon, a new
point will be inserted at that position.

If the user keeps the shift key pressed and clicks on a vertex of a selected LineString or Polygon,
then that vertex will be removed from the feature.

===== image:PositionEditorDeleteTool.png[Delete Tool, 18] Delete Tool

When the _Delete Tool_ is selected, the user can quickly delete all the features that the user
clicks on in the map.

==== Action Button Panel ====

The next row of buttons is for various actions. Clicking the "Cancel" button will cancel all
changes and close the editor.

Clicking "OK" will update the underlying graphical model and close the editor.

Clicking the image:PositionEditorToggleFeatures.png[Toggle Show Features, 18] Show/Hide Features
toggle button will alternately show and hide the _Features Panel_.

==== Action Menu ====

image::PositionEditorActionMenu.png[Position Editor Action Menu, 140]

The _Action Menu_ contains a multitude of functions for manipulating the features of the
_Position Editor_.

The actual list of functions in the menu depends on the current feature selection.

===== Clear All Action

The _Clear All_ action will clear the editor.

===== Zoom to Extent Action

When enacting the _Zoom to Extent_ action, the editor map will pan and zoom so as to include
all the features of the geographical model.

===== Edit as Text Action

The _Edit as Text_ option is only available when the no geometry has been defined, or the
geometry is sufficiently simple.

The edited geometry will be opened in the <<Text Editor>> described in a previous section.

===== Import Action

The _Import_ action will open a dialog and allow the user to import any geometry defined for
an existing area.

===== Add Affected Radius Action

If one or more features are selected, the user can enact the _Add affected radius_ action to
add an affected area with a certain radius around the selected feature(s).

image::PositionEditorAffectedRadius.png[Position Editor Affected Radius, 400]

The affected radius feature is tied to the features it was created from (its _parent features_),
so, if the user moves or modifies any of the parent features, the affected radius feature
will be re-computed.

The user can also update the radius distance of the affected radius feature, whereupon its
geometry will be re-computed.

Lastly, the user can select the type of restriction that applies to the affected area. By default
the value is "Affected". However, the user can choose "Restricted", "Speed restricted", "Prohibited"
and "Stopping prohibited" as well.

===== Add Affected Radius Action

If two or more _Point_ features are selected, the user can enact the _Add affected path_ action to
add an affected path as defined by the points in the order they appear.

image::PositionEditorAffectedPath.png[Position Editor Affected Path, 400]

The affected path feature is tied to the points it was created from (its _parent features_),
so, if the user moves any of the parent features, the affected path feature
will be re-computed.

The user can also select the type of restriction that applies to the affected path. By default
the value is "Affected". However, the user can choose "Restricted", "Speed restricted", "Prohibited"
and "Stopping prohibited" as well.

===== Add Affected Area Action

If three or more _Point_ features are selected, the user can enact the _Add affected area_ action to
add an affected area spanned by the points in the order they appear.

image::PositionEditorAffectedArea.png[Position Editor Affected Area, 400]

The affected area feature is tied to the points it was created from (its _parent features_),
so, if the user moves any of the parent features, the affected area feature
will be re-computed.

The user can also select the type of restriction that applies to the affected area. By default
the value is "Affected". However, the user can choose "Restricted", "Speed restricted", "Prohibited"
and "Stopping prohibited" as well.

===== Merge Geometries Action

If two or more features are selected, the user can enact the _Merge Geometries_ action.

The merge function will attempt to be intelligent, depending of the type of the selected features.

* If all the selected features a of type _Point_ or _MultiPoint_ the resulting feature will be of
  type _MultiPoint_.
* If all the selected features a of type _LineString_ or _MultiLineString_ the resulting feature
  will be of type _MultiLineString_.
* If all the selected features a of type _Polygon_ or _MultiPolygon_ the resulting feature
  will be of type _MultiPolygon_.

If none of these criteria applies, the resulting feature will be of type _GeometryCollection_.

===== Split Geometries Action

If one or more features are selected, the user can enact the _Split Geometries_ action.

The split function will attempt to be intelligent, depending of the type of the selected features.

* A _MultiPoint_ feature will be split into separate _Point_ features.
* A _MultiLineString_ feature will be split into separate _LineString_ features.
* A _MultiPolygon_ feature will be split into separate _Polygon_ features.
* A _GeometryCollection_ feature will be split into its individual geometries.
* A _LineString_ feature will be split into separate _Point_ features.
* A _Polygon_ feature will be split into separate _Point_ features.

===== Subtract Geometries Action

If two or more _Polygon_ features are selected, the user can enact the _Subtract Geometries_ action.
The resulting polygon will be identical to the first selected polygon, but with all other
polygons subtracted (i.e. leaving holes).

===== Convert to LineString Action

If a _MultiPoint_ or a _Polygon_ feature is selected, the user can enact the
_Convert to LineString_ action.
The resulting _LineString_ feature will form a path between all involved coordinates.

===== Convert to Polygon Action

If a _MultiPoint_ or a _LineString_ feature is selected, the user can enact the
_Convert to Polygon_ action.
The resulting _Polygon_ feature will form a polygon spanned by all involved coordinates.

===== Convert to MultiPoint Action

If a _Polygon_ or a _LineString_ feature is selected, the user can enact the
_Convert to MultiPoint_ action.
The resulting _MultiPoint_ feature will contain all involved coordinates.

==== Features Panel ====

image::PositionEditorFeaturePanel.png[Position Editor Feature Panel, 200]

When the _Features Panel_ is visible, it will list a _Feature Panel_ for all defined
features.

. The feature selection checkbox will toggle the selection state of the feature.
. The zoom-to-extent arrow will pan and zoom the map to the extent of the given feature.
. The trash icon will delete the feature, and the drag-handle icon can be used to re-arrange
  the features in the _Features Panel_.
. When the _Name_ toggle-button is pressed, there will be _feature name_ input fields for all
  supported model languages. A client (e.g. an ECDIS-client) may chose to display the label
  at the center of the feature.
. When the _Restriction_ toggle-button is pressed, there will be a _restriction_ menu for selecting
  a restriction that applies to the feature.
  Possible values are "Affected",  "Restricted", "Speed restricted", "Prohibited"
  and "Stopping prohibited".
  A client (e.g. an ECDIS-client) may chose to use the restriction flag to drive portrayal or have
  an effect in route computations, etc.
. The geometry tree will allow a user to inspect and modify the coordinates and coordinate names
  of the actual feature geometry. The geometry tree can be navigated using the mouse or keyboard
  keys such as arrow-up, arrow-down, arrow-left (collapse node), arrow-right (expand node), F2 or enter
  (start editing coordinates or coordinate names) and enter to submit changes.
  The coordinate names, nested below each coordinate, and available in all supported model languages,
  may be displayed by a client (e.g. an ECDIS-client) next to the actual position on a map.
  To a certain extent, the user can also add or remove coordinates by clicking the plus or minus sign
  displayed next to a selected coordinate.
