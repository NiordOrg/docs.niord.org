== Home

The _Home_ page of Niord is little more than a splash screen that displays a map with
the list of in-force NW and NM messages of the currently selected domain.

The page shares its main menu (top) with all other pages.
This chapter details the common functionality of the Niord system, such as log-in,
domain and language selection; all accessible via the main menu.

=== Login

Prior to logging in to Niord, the user should contact a Niord administrator to ensure
that she is a registered user and has the proper roles assigned for the respective domains.

In order to log in, click the _Login_ link of the main menu, or the _Login_ button of the
Home page.

The actual login mechanism is configured by a Niord system administrator. The set-up used
by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA) is as follows:

* When the user is an employee working within the DMA network (either _in situ_ or via VPN),
  she can click the "DMA" button on the login page.
  Since Niord is integrated with the DMA ADFS, the user
  may then use the usual DMA work place credentials for authentication.
* Outside the DMA network, or indeed for Niord users that are not DMA employees, the user
  can log in using a pre-assigned username and password.
  For added security, the user will subsequently be asked for a _one-time code_
  as provided by the _Google Authenticator_ App on their mobile phone.

Once the user has successfully logged in, the main menu _Login_ link will be replaced with
a user menu, containing the options to log out and edit the user profile - including setting
a new password.

=== Domain Selection

As described in the <<Editors Manual>> section, you always work within a current _domain_ in Niord.
The current domain is selected from the domain menu:

Next to each domain name, there is a symbol that indicates if the user can edit messages of that
domain (pencil symbol), or only view public messages (eye symbol).

The current domain selection is stored in a cookie in the web-browser, and so, will also be
the selected domain next time the user access Niord.

To make the current domain selection more visible to the user, each domain is assigned a colour
that is displayed in the main menu (green for NM in this example).


=== Language Selection

Niord can be configured to support any number of website languages (i.e. the language used for
menus, text and labels in the Niord website) and any number of NW-NM message
model languages (i.e. the languages that the produced NW and NM messages include).
Typically, however, a Niord system supports two languages; the local language and English.

The currently selected website language is selected from the Language menu:

As with the current domain selection, the current language selection is stored in a cookie
in the web-browser, and so, will also be the selected language next time the user access Niord.
