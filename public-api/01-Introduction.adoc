== Introduction

This document describes a public REST API defined by the *Niord* Nautical Information Directory
project as of {releaseDate}.

The API detailed on this site does _not_ cover the extensive REST API used internally by the Niord web application,
but rather, describes the simple public REST interface that may be used by third-party applications
(websites, apps, etc.) for fetching in-force navigational warnings (NW) and notices to mariners (NM).

An example client website using the Niord Public API can be found at
https://nautiskinformation.soefartsstyrelsen.dk/#/messages/map[nautiskinformation.soefartsstyrelsen.dk^]

The actual source for the API is available at
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-web[the Niord Web Github Repository^]
