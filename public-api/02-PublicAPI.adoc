== Niord Public API

The Niord Public API is a simple public REST API for fetching nautical information, i.e.
 Navigational Warnings (NW) and Notices to Mariners (NM), from a Niord System.

=== Niord Message Data Model
The Niord Message Model is the combined model used to represent Navigational Warnings and Notices to Mariners.

The model is used as an interchange format when communicating NW and NM messages with the Niord Editing System
and compatible systems.

The data model for the NW and NM messages is detailed in the link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model]
document.
