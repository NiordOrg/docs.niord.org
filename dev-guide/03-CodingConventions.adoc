== Coding Conventions

Niord is fairly consistent about using naming and coding conventions, and understanding these conventions
makes it easier to read the code.

Each _logical entity_ of Niord, such as an _area_, a _chart_, a _message_ or a _publication_, is
implemented using JPA entities, JSON-serializable value objects, business logic, REST interfaces, and
batch import classes.

=== Area Example

As an example, consider the _Area_ entity, which represents a specific area in the Areas tree. The classes used
to implement areas, can be seen below:

The classes are spread across three niord sub-projects:

|Projects|Description

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-model[niord-model]
| Contains the link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model]. The message model is made up of
  value objects (with a _Vo_ suffix) which are JSON-serializable. +
  Third-party application can define a dependency on this project if they integrate with Niord via
  the link:../public-api/api.html[Public REST API].

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-core[niord-core]
| Contains the actual entity classes and business logic (session beans). +
  May also define system model value objects, in as much as these may extend the niord-model classes.

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-web[niord-web]
| Contains the JAX-RS REST interface used by clients (such as the Niord web application) to access the
  entities and execute business logic. +
  The REST interface is typically a thin wrapper on top of the service interface defined in niord-core.
  However, the REST interface also performs all the security and permission checks used to protect the
  Niord system.
