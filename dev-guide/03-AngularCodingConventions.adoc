== Angular Coding Conventions

The other big chunk of code in Niord is the AngularJS and JavaScript-based web application.

=== Organization of Angular Sources

The web application is organized as follows:

All source files developed as part of Niord, is placed in the _app_ folder.
All external dependencies, such as third-party AngularJS directives, are placed in the _ext_ folder.

Under _app_, the angular sources, such as directives, controllers, services and partials (html),
are primarily organized by _main page_.
So, all sources for the _Messages_ page are in the _messages_ folder, etc.
