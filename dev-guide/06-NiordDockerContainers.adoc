== Niord Docker Containers

The previous sections described how to set up and configure a Niord development environment,
which relied Docker containers for running MySQL and Keycloak. +
Docker containers is indeed a very flexible and convenient way of running Niord,
even in test and production.

This section will outline how to create and push docker containers for Niord. If you do not
rely on standard containers, please create your own Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com, and
update the scripts and procedures accordingly. +
In particular, you will need to create a Docker Hub repo for your own customized _niord-appsrv_.

The https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord-docker[niord-docker] repository contains a collection
of bash scripts for creating and pushing docker containers, which may be used for inspiration.

=== Prerequisites

In order to build the projects and create docker containers, the following should be installed:

* Java 8
* Docker
* Docker Compose

=== Checking out Projects

Assume that you have checked out the following projects, which is the Danish flavoured Niord system:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord.git
git clone https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord-dk.git
git clone https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord-proxy.git
git clone https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord-docker.git
----

=== Building Projects

A standard update script could execute the following updates:

[source,bash]
----
# Build niord project
cd niord
git pull
mvn clean install

# Build niord-dk project.
# NB: use the "dist" profile as this will merge JavaScripts and CSS files
#     into single files and enable support for HTML 5 App Cache.
cd ../niord-dk
git pull
mvn -P dist clean install

# Build niord-proxy project
cd ../niord-proxy
git pull
mvn clean install

# Update niord-docker
cd ../niord-docker
git pull
----

=== Creating Docker Containers

The example below demonstrates how to build some of the relevant docker containers.
Create your own versions of the scripts which points to your own Docker Hub organization
rather than _dmadk_.

[source,bash]
----
# log in to dockerhub in order to push the images
docker login

# Build niord-appsrv docker image
cd niord-docker/02-niord-appsrv/
./build-niord-appsrv.sh build ../../niord-dk/niord-dk-web/target/niord-dk-web.war
./build-niord-appsrv.sh push

# Build niord-keycloak docker image
cd ../03-niord-keycloak/
./build-niord-keycloak.sh build
./build-niord-keycloak.sh push

# Build niord-proxy docker image
cd ../06-niord-proxy/
./build-niord-proxy.sh build ../../niord-proxy/target/niord-proxy-swarm.jar
./build-niord-proxy.sh push
----

=== Running a Complete Niord System

The following example will illustrate how to run a complete Niord system using Docker containers.

The example is based on the _GhanaNautical.info_ project, which is a Ghana-flavoured version
of Niord, since this is a very self-contained set-up where everything is created within a single
Amazon WS account, ranging from an EC2 linux instance, the purchase of DNS names, generation
of SSL certificates, configuration of mail accounts, SMTP, etc.

Setting up and configuring Amazon WS is beyond the scope of this manual, which will merely focus
on how to run Niord as Docker-containers withing the Amazon WS infrastructure depicted below.

In this set-up the $NIORD_HOME directory is situated at +/data/niord-gh+. An initial bootstrapping
settings file should be created at +/data/niord-gh/niord.json+:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "key"         : "niord.home",
    "description" : "The root directory for the Niord application",
    "value"       : "/data/niord-gh",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
  },
  {
    "key"         : "baseUri",
    "description" : "The base application server URI",
    "value"       : "https://niord.ghananautical.info",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
  },
  {
    "key"         : "authServerUrl",
    "description" : "The Keycloak URL",
    "value"       : "https://niord-keycloak.ghananautical.info/auth",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
  },
  {
    "key"         : "authServerSslRequired",
    "description" : "Either 'external', 'none' or 'all'",
    "value"       : "none",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
 },
 {
    "key" : "mailSender",
    "description" : "The sender e-mail address",
    "value" : "niord@ghananautical.info",
    "web" : false,
    "editable" : true
 },
 {
    "key" : "mailValidRecipients",
    "description" : "Comma-separated list of valid mail recipients, or 'ALL' for all recipients, or 'LOG' for simulation",
    "value" : "ALL",
    "web" : false,
    "editable" : true
 }
]
----

Next, create a +.env+ file in the working directory of the linux user. This should contain passwords
and settings for _docker-compose_:

[source,conf]
----
NIORD_HOME=/data/niord-gh
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=TBD
KCDB_PASSWORD=TBD
NIORDDB_PASSWORD=TBD
AMAZON_SES_USER=TBD
AMAZON_SES_PASSWORD=TBD
PROXY_TRACKING_ID=TBD
----

Start the Niord system from the docker-compose file found in the
https://github.com/GhanaNauticalnfo/niord-gh[niord-gh] Github repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/GhanaNauticalnfo/niord-gh.git
docker-compose -f niord-gh/docker/docker-test-compose.yml pull
docker-compose -f niord-gh/docker/docker-test-compose.yml up -d
----

The first time the Niord system is started, add a Keycloak admin user,
which can be used to create user groups and assign domain roles to the groups:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/niord-gh
./keycloak-admin-user.sh
----

Also, deploy the initial base data (charts, areas, domains, etc.) for the new installation:

[source,bash]
----
zip -j /tmp/niord-basedata.zip ~/niord-gh/niord-gh-basedata/*.json
sudo mkdir -p /data/niord-gh/batch-jobs/batch-sets/
sudo mv /tmp/niord-basedata.zip /data/niord-gh/batch-jobs/batch-sets/
----

Within a minute or so, this will import domains, areas, categories, etc., needed to run
the Niord Ghana project. First clean up a bit:

* In Niord, under Sysadmin -> Domains, click the "Create in Keycloak" button for
  the "NW" and "NM" domains. This will create the two domains in Keycloak.
* In Keycloak, edit the "Sysadmin" user group. Under "Role Mappings", select first
  "niord-nw" then "niord-nm" and assign the "sysadmin" client roles to the group.
* While in Keycloak, you may also want to define new user groups for editors and admins,
  and assign the appropriate client roles for "niord-nw" and "niord-nm" to the groups.
  Additionally, for admin-related groups (who should be able to manage users in Niord),
  assign the "manage-clients" and "manage-users" client roles of the "realm-management"
  client to the groups.
* Delete the "Master" domain in Niord and the corresponding "niord-client-master" client in Keycloak.
* Go through the configuration and settings of the Niord Sysadmin pages and adjust as appropriate.

Lastly, update the root crontab, using "sudo crontab -e", to call the niord-backup
docker script periodically:

[source,bash]
----
45 * * * * /usr/bin/docker exec niord-backup /hourly-backup.sh >> /data/niord-gh/backup/backup.log 2>&1
20 07 * * * /usr/bin/docker exec niord-backup /daily-backup.sh >> /data/niord-gh/backup/backup.log 2>&1
