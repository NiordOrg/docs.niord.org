== Introduction

Niord (Nautical Information Directory) is a system for producing and publishing
Navigational Warnings (_NW_) and Notices to Mariners T&P (_NM_).

It was originally developed as part of the http://efficiensea2.org[EfficienSea2] EU project
and subsequently implemented as a production system for the
http://www.dma.dk/[Danish Maritime Authority].

Some of the main features of Niord area:

* Niord provides an advanced and highly customizable production system for NW and NM T&P.
* It includes a plug-in architecture for NW and NM message promulgation via e.g. mailing lists
  and Twitter.
* Niord also integrates with the http://maritimecloud.net[Maritime Cloud] by defining a
  Maritime Cloud Service Specification and making NW & NM messages accessible via a
  link:../public-api/api.html[Public REST API]
* The link:../public-model/model.html[combined NW & NM message model] adopted by Niord has
  been devised to make data future-compatible with the upcoming IHO S-124 specification.

This guide should be read by developers of Niord.
It will detail how to set up a development environment, coding conventions, etc.
