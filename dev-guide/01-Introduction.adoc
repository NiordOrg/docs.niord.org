== Introduction

Niord (Nautical Information Directory) is a system for producing and publishing
Navigational Warnings (_NW_) and Notices to Mariners T&P (_NM_).

It was originally developed as part of the http://efficiensea2.org[EfficienSea2] EU project
and subsequently implemented as a production system for the
http://www.dma.dk/[Danish Maritime Authority].

This guide should be read by developers of Niord. It will use the Danish Niord system as a use case.

The guide will cover the following topics:

* How to set up a development environment
* Coding conventions, etc.

=== Developer Profile

For the development process to be effective, the developer sshould preferably have a thorough knowledge
of the following technologies:

* Java 8
* Java EE 7: Niord uses the entire Java EE 7 stack, specially EJB, JPA, JAX-RS, Servlets, Batch API,
             CDI, etc.
* AngularJS + Bootstrap
* MySQL
* Docker

It would also be advantageous, if the developer has some knowledge of the following technologies:

* OpenLayers
* Wildfly 10
* JBOSS Keycloak
* Freemarker
* Maven
* Git(hub)

Furthermore, the actual Niord source code also has a certain learning curve.
