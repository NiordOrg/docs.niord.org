== Java Coding Conventions

Niord is fairly consistent about using naming and coding conventions, and understanding these conventions
makes it easier to read the code.

Each _logical entity_ of Niord, such as an _area_, a _chart_, a _message_ or a _publication_, is
implemented using JPA entities, JSON-serializable value objects, business logic, REST interfaces, and
batch import classes.

=== Area Example

As an example, consider the _Area_ entity, which represents a specific area in the Areas tree. The classes used
to implement areas, can be seen below:

The classes are spread across three niord sub-projects:

|Projects|Description

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-model[niord-model]
| Contains the link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model]. The message model is made up of
  value objects. +
  Third-party application can define a dependency on this project if they integrate with Niord via
  the link:../public-api/api.html[Public REST API].

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-core[niord-core]
| Contains the actual entity classes and business logic (session beans). +
  May also define system model value objects, in as much as these may extend the niord-model classes.

| https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/tree/master/niord-web[niord-web]
| Contains the JAX-RS REST interface used by clients (such as the Niord web application) to access the
  entities and execute business logic.

==== Classes and Naming Conventions

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Classes|Description

| +AreaVo+
| The link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model] representation of an area. +
  The +Vo+ suffix is used for all _value objects_, which are essentially JSON-serializable
  versions of the real entities.

| +AreaDescVo+
| Contains a language code and all localizable attributes of +AreaVo+.
  These associated entities have a +Desc+ suffix, as in +AreaDescVo+.

| +Area+
| The JPA entity definition of an area. +
  Whereas there will be a strong correlation between the attributes of the +Area+ entity and the +AreaVo+
  value object, the entity class may define additional attributes, which are not part of the
  public niord-model class. The entity class thus constitutes a _system model_.

| +AreaDesc+
| The JPA entity definition of the area description entity, i.e. the localizable attributes of an area.

| +SystemAreaVo+
| When a _system model_ entity, such as +Area+, contains attributes not included in the value objects
  of the link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model], then a value object with a +System+ prefix
  is introduced to capture the additional attributes. +
  As such, +SystemAreaVo+ will extend +AreaVo+ and includes the additional attributes.

| +AreaService+
| Each entity will have a companion stateless session bean or singleton EJB, with a +Service+ suffix.
  This class defines the business logic and life-cycle management functions of the entity.

| +BatchAreaImportReader+ +
  +BatchAreaImportProcessor+ +
  +BatchAreaImportWriter+
| Many of the Niord model entities have an associated batch job for importing the entities. +
  The batch job is typically implemented using the Java EE batch API, and the three phases
  will be implemented by classes that have a +Batch+ prefix and the +Reader+, +Processor+ and +Writer+
  suffixes respectively.

| +AreaRestService+
| Each Niord entity will also be associated with a JAX-RS REST interface. +
  This interface is typically a thin wrapper on top of the service interface, and will have the
  +RestService+ suffix. +
  The REST interface also performs all the security and permission checks used to protect the
  Niord system.

=== Localization

Almost all entities in Niord are localizable to any number of languages. +
As can be seen from the link:../model/model.html[Niord Message Model], this is implemented by
associating an entity with a list of classes that contain a language code
and all localizable attributes.

Area contains one localizable attributes; _name_:

[source,java]
----
public class AreaVo implements ILocalizable<AreaDescVo>, IJsonSerializable {
    List<AreaDescVo> descs;
}

public class AreaDescVo implements ILocalizedDesc, IJsonSerializable {
    String lang;
    String name;
}
----


=== Serialization and De-serialization

All Niord entities have methods for converting to and fro their _value object_ representation.

In the simplest form, the JPA entity model will define a constructor that takes the _value object_
representation as a parameter, and it will have a +toVo()+ function that returns the _value object_
representation of the entity. Example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Domain extends BaseEntity<Integer> {
    public Domain() {}
    public Domain(DomainVo domain) {
        // Instantiate entity from value object
    }
    public DomainVo toVo() {
        // instantiate and return a value object from entity
    }
}
----

Sometimes, however, things are a little more complex, as is the case for +Area+.

+Area+ has two _value object_ representations, +AreaVo+ and +SystemAreaVo+.
When, say, a public REST API call returns a message with an associated area, then the +AreaVo+ should be
returned. If, however, a system administrator edits an area via the Niord webapp, then the +SystemAreaVo+
representation should be used. +
So, +Area.toVo()+ actually takes the target value object class as a parameter, and leave it to the
REST service to decide which representation to use.

Another complexity in serializing an entity to its _value object_, is that often you wish to exact
control over which fields to return. +
One example is language control. Most of the REST API calls will only return the localizable entities
(e.g. +AreaDescVo+) for the requested language. This preserves bandwidth and makes client code simpler. +
Another good example is control over the hierarchical relationship of Areas.
When a message with an associated area (say, "Kattegat") is returned from a REST call, then you want
the _parent_ relationship of areas to be included ("Kattegat" should include a parent-reference
to "Denmark). Alternatively, when editing the area tree on the _Areas_ admin page, then you want
the REST call to return root areas with their _children_ relationship.

To facilitate this type of serialization control, Niord use a +DataFilter+ helper class, which
defines the fields and language to include. To control the serialization of an entire tree of
related entities, the fields can be prefixed with the entity name, as seen in the example below:

[source,java]
----
DataFilter filter = DataFilter.get()
    .fields("Message.details", "Message.geometry", "Area.parent", "Category.parent")
    .lang("en");
----

Hence, the resulting serialization code for +Area+ will thus be:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Area extends TreeBaseEntity<Area> implements ILocalizable<AreaDesc> {
    public Area() {}
    public Area(AreaVo area, DataFilter filter) {
        // Instantiate entity from value object
    }
    public <A extends AreaVo> A toVo(Class<A> clz, DataFilter filter) {
        // instantiate and return a value object from entity
    }
}
----
