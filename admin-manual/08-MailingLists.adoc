== Mailing Lists

The _Mailing Lists_ page allows an administrator to manage the list recipients to mailing lists.

IMPORTANT: The _Mailing Lists_ page has a lot more functionality for _system administrators_, who can create
and manage the mailing lists, define the _triggers_ that will causes a mailing list to be sent
and create the reports that generate the actual mail contents. This is detailed in the _User Manual for Sysadmins_,
whereas this chapter only details the functionality for normal administrators.
