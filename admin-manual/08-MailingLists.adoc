== Mailing Lists

The _Mailing Lists_ page allows an administrator to manage the recipients of the mailing lists.

IMPORTANT: The _Mailing Lists_ page has a lot more functionality for _system administrators_, who can create
and manage the mailing lists, define the _triggers_ that cause mailing lists to execute,
and create the reports that generate the actual mail contents. This is detailed in the _User Manual for Sysadmins_,
whereas this chapter only details the functionality for normal administrators.

=== Manage Mailing List Recipients

The administrator manages the recipients of a mailing list by clicking the recipient icon next to the
mailing list.

The will open the mailing list _Recipients Panel_:

There are two main types of recipients; _users_ and _contacts_.
The two tabs look identical, except that the former is for managing the users that should be mailing list recipients,
and the latter is for managing the contacts that should be mailing list recipients.
Hence, only the _Users_ tab is detailed in this section.

The "Selected" panel in the left side displays the list of users currently assigned to the mailing list.
The "Unselected" panel in the right side displays all remaining users.

Users can be removed from the selection by clicking the "Remove" link next to them. Similarly, they can
be added to the selection by clicking "Add".
Clicking "Remove All" will clear the selection, whereas clicking "Add All" will select all users.

The lists of users in both panels can be filtered by typing a term into the "Filter" input field, which will be
matched against a users' name and e-mails address.

No changes the list of recipient users is persisted until the "Save User Selection" button is clicked.
Clicking "Cancel" will discard all changes and return to the main mailing list page.
