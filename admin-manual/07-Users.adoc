== Users & Contacts

The _Users & Contacts_ page allows administrators to manage users and contacts in the Niord system.

image::UsersPage.png[Users & Contacts, 600]

The main difference between _users_ and _contacts_ is that users can actually log in and work in Niord,
whereas contacts are solely maintained in Niord as recipients of mailing lists.

=== Users Tab

The _Users_ tab can be used to add and manage users, and, in particular, assign users to the proper user
groups to grant them various levels of access in the different domains of Niord.

The list of users can be filtered by typing a term in the _Filter_ input field above the user list, which will
be matched against the users' name and e-mail address.

==== Adding or Editing a User

Depending on how Niord has been configured, some types of users should not be added manually in Niord, but are
created automatically via integration with other identity registries.

For instance, in the set-up used by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA), Niord is integrated with the
_DMA Active Directory Federation Service_, and hence, the first time a DMA employee clicks the "DMA" link
on the log-in page and logs in using her usual work credentials, she will automatically be created as
a user in Niord.

However, the new user still needs to be assigned proper user roles by a Niord administrator, and
the administrator must also create users that are not employees as described next.

An administrator can add a new user by clicking the "Add" button, or edit an existing user by clicking
the pencil symbol next to the user.

This will open the _User Details Panel_:

The user attributes that can be edited are as follows:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| User Attribute
| Description

| Username
| A user must have a unique user name, that they can use when logging in.

| E-mail
| A user must have a unique e-mail address.

| Name
| The name of the user.

| Password
| The user password.

| Preferred Language
| The preferred language is used in the mails sent out via mailing lists.

| Update Profile
| If the _Update Profile_ flag is checked, the user will be asked to revise and update their user profile
  upon next log-in.

| Update Password
| If the _Update Password_ flag is checked, the user will be asked to update their password
  upon next log-in.

| Update E-mail
| If the _Update E-mail_ flag is checked, the user will be asked to update their e-mail address
  upon next log-in.

==== Managing User Group Membership

As described in the <<Administrators Manual>> chapter, all users have different roles in different domains.
The available roles are _User_, _Editor_, _Admin_ and _Sysadmin_; and with a good handful of domains in Niord,
this leaves _a lot_ of user-role relationships to maintain.

To simplify user management, Niord instead let administrators assign users to _user groups_,
where each user group in turn defines a set of roles for all domains.

The configuration of user groups is handled by system administrators, and will seldom change. At the Danish
Maritime Authority, the following user groups are defined, at the time of writing:

* _Sysadmin_: Members of the "Sysadmin" user group will have the _Sysadmin_ role in all domains.
* _Admins_: Members of the "Admins" user group will have the _Admin_ role in all domains.
* _Editors_: Members of the "Editor" user group will have the _Editor_ role in the "NW", "NM", "Firing Areas",
  "NM Almanac", "NM Annex" and "NW Greenland" domains.
* _Case Officers_: Members of the "Case Officers" user group will have the _User_ role the "NW", "NM", "Firing Areas",
  "NM Almanac", "NM Annex" and "NW Greenland" domains.
* _FE Editors_: Members of the "FE Editors" user group will have the _Editor_ role in the "Firing Areas" domain.

The place to manage group membership for a user is the _Group Membership_ tab of the _User Details Panel_.

image::UserGroupsPanel.png[User Groups Editor Panel, 400]

The "Group Membership" panel at the left side will list all user groups that the user is currently member of.
The administrator can click the trash icon to remove the user from a group.

The available user groups are in the "Available Groups" panel at the right side.
The administrator can select a group and click the "Join" button to make the user member of the selected group.

Note however, that some of the available groups may be disabled (gray), and thus, cannot be selected. This is
because the administrator may not have access-rights to assign members to those groups.
For instance, an administrator that is herself member of the "Admins" group, should never be allowed to assign
anybody (including herself) to the "Sysadmin" group.
Similarly, the selectable user groups may depend on the currently selected domain, since the administrator may
be the administrator in the current domain, but not in the domain that a user groups would give access rights to.

==== Managing User Mailing Lists

image::UserMailingListsPanel.png[User Mailing Lists Panel, 400]

An administrator can also manage the mailing lists for a user via the _Mailing Lists_ tab
of the _User Details Panel_.

For each available mailing list, the administrator can either click the "Join" button to add the
user as a recipient, or click the "Leave" button to remove the user as a recipient.

==== Deleting a User

A user can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to the user in the user list. However, this will only
work if the user has no _revision history_, that is, has never created or edited messages or comments.

If the user does have a revision history, the administrator can instead reset the users password and remove
the user from all user groups.

=== Contacts Tab

image::ContactsPanel.png[Contacts Panel, 400]

The _Contacts_ tab can be used to add and manage contacts.

The list of contacts may be long and is thus divided into pages of 20 contacts. The pages can be navigated
using the pagination controls below the contact list.

Furthermore, the contacts can be filtered by typing a term in the _Filter_ input field above the contact list,
which will be matched against the contacts' name and e-mail address.

==== Adding or Editing a Contact

An administrator can add a new contact by clicking the "Add" button, or edit an existing contact by clicking
the pencil symbol next to the contact.

This will open the _Contact Details Panel_:

image::ContactDetailsPanel.png[Contact Details Panel, 400]

The contact attributes that can be edited are as follows:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Contact Attribute
| Description

| E-mail
| A contact must have a unique e-mail address.

| Name
| The name of the contact.

| Preferred Language
| The preferred language is used in the mails sent out via mailing lists.

==== Managing Contact Mailing Lists

image::ContactMailingListsPanel.png[Contact Mailing Lists Panel, 400]

An administrator can also manage the mailing lists for a contact via the _Mailing Lists_ tab
of the _Contact Details Panel_.

For each available mailing list, the administrator can either click the "Join" button to add the
contact as a recipient, or click the "Leave" button to remove the contact as a recipient.


==== Deleting a Contact

A contact can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to the contact in the contact list.

=== Importing and Exporting Contacts

The administrator can export and import contacts from the action menu above the contact list.

Enacting the _Export_ function will generate a text file in a comma-separated format with fields for
e-mail, first name, last name and preferred language.

Enacting the _Import_ function, will prompt the administrator to type a comma-, semicolon- or newline-separated
list of e-mail addresses into a text-field, and import these contacts.
Existing e-mail addresses will be ignored. The newly imported contacts should - in time - be updated with proper
names and preferred language selection.
