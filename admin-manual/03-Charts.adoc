== Charts

The _Charts_ page allows an administrator to manage the list of nautical charts that may be associated with
notices to mariners and navigational warnings, and can be used for filtering message search results.

The list of charts is divided into pages of 10 charts, and may be navigated using the pagination control below
the chart list.
Alternatively, the user may filter the list of charts by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field above the
chart list. The term is matched against the name and number of the charts.

The map at the right side of the page depicts the extents of the charts currently displayed.

=== Adding or Editing a Chart

The user can add a new nautical chart by clicking the "New Chart" button, or edit a chart by clicking
the pencil symbol next to the chart.

This will open the _Chart Edit Page_:

The geographical extent of a chart can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button at the map. This will open
a graphical editor and allow the user to define the extent by one or more polygons (rectangles)

The functionality of the graphical editor is described in more detail in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html[User Manual for Editors].

=== Deleting a Chart

Charts can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them. However, this only works if the chart being
deleted has never been assigned to a message.

If a chart has indeed been assigned to a message, the user should deactivate the chart instead.
