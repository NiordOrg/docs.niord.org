== Sources

The _Sources_ page allows an administrator to manage a list of sources, so that they can
be assigned to messages in the message editor in a consistent and localized manner, using
the proper abbreviations.

The list of sources is divided into pages of 20 sources, and may be navigated using the
pagination control below the source list.
Alternatively, the user may filter the list of sources by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field
above the list. The term is matched against the name and abbreviation of the source.

=== Adding or Editing Sources

The user may add a new source by clicking the "New Source" button above
the sources list, or edit an existing source by clicking the pencil icon next to it.

This will open the _Source Editor Page_:

The editable attributes of a source are listed below:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Source Attribute
| Description

| Active
| Only active source may be assigned to a message in the message editor.

| Name
| The name of the source in all supported model languages.

| Abbreviation

|===

=== Deleting a Source

A source can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to it.

=== Message Editor Source Field

In the message editor, source abbreviations can be added to a message in the _Sources_ editor field
by clicking the "Add sources" button.

This will open a dialog and allow the user to search and select the sources to add along with the
date of the source interaction.

=== Importing and Exporting Sources

The administrator can export and import sources from the action menu above the sources list.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/source/vo/SourceVo.java[SourceVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "active": true,
    "descs": [
      {
        "lang": "da",
        "name": "Arktisk Kommando",
        "abbreviation": "AKO"
      },
      {
        "lang": "en",
        "name": "Joint Arctic Command",
        "abbreviation": "JACMD "
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing a source JSON file will trigger the _source-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a source JSON file on the _Sources_ page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/sources-import/in_ folder.
