== Areas

The _Areas_ page allows an administrator to manage the hierarchical tree of areas that may be associated with
notices to mariners and navigational warnings, and can be used for filtering message search results.

image::AreasPage.png[Areas, 600]

The area tree is navigated like a file system directory.
Additionally, the user may filter the areas by typing a term into the _Filter Areas_ input field above the
area tree. The term is matched against the name of the areas.

=== Adding or Editing an Area

The user can add a new area by clicking the "Add" button, or edit an area by selecting it in the area tree.

When adding a new area, it will be a child-area of the currently selected area in the area tree. If no area
is selected, the new area will become a new root area.

The details of the new or edited area will be present in the _Area Editor Panel_ next to the area tree
(see screenshot above).

The simple editable attributes of an area are listed below:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Area Attribute
| Description

| Active
| Only an active area can be assigned to a message.

| Name
| The name of the area in all supported model languages.

| MRN
| Optionally, specify a _Maritime Resource Name_ (a unique URN) for the area. Defining MRNs for areas will facilitate
  better integration between Niord systems of different countries.

| Type
| Optionally, specify the area type. Currently, "Country" and "Firing Area" are the only supported types.

| Additional Editor Fields
| Can be used to enable extra fields in the message editor when the area is assigned to the message.
  As an example, if a firing practice area is assigned to a navigational warning, it might make sense to show
  the "Signals" editor field, not normally enabled for navigational warnings, in the message editor.

==== Message Sorting Editor Field

The _Message Sorting_ editor field determines how to sort messages, when the message list is
sorted by area. The valid options are:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Message Sorting
| Description

| Area order
| This is the default behaviour. The order of messages assigned to an area, or any of its sub-areas,
  is determined by the area order.
  So, in the example above, "Denmark" is e.g. sorted before "Faroe Islands", and within "Denmark", "The Baltic Sea"
  is sorted before "The Sound", etc.

| North-South
| Messages associated with an area sorted "North-South", or any of its sub-areas, will be sorted
  North-to-South by the latitude of their geometrical center.

| South-North
| Reverse order of "North-South".

| East-West
| Messages associated with an area sorted "East-West", or any of its sub-areas, will be sorted
  East-to-West by the longitude of their geometrical center.

| West-East
| Reverse order of "East-West".

| Clockwise
| If an area is flagged as sorting "Clockwise", then messages associated with the area, or any of its subareas,
  will be sorted in clockwise order around the given position, starting at the given bearing.

| Counter-Clockwise
| Reverse order of "Clockwise".

|===

This automated sorting of messages by area can subsequently be overridden manually, as described in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#sort-area-action[Sort Area Action] chapter.

==== Extent Editor Field

The geographical extent of an area can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button at the _Extent_ editor field map.
This will open a graphical editor and allow the user to define the geographical extent.

The functionality of the graphical editor is described in more detail in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html[User Manual for Editors].

=== Reorganizing Areas

The hierarchical order of the areas are updated in two ways:

* To move an area to a different parent area, use drag-and-drop.
* To move an area to another position under the same parent area, use the up- and down-arrow buttons above
  the area tree.

=== Deleting an Area

An area, including all its sub-areas, can be deleted by selecting it and then click the "Delete" button
above the area tree.
However, this only works if neither the selected area, nor any of its sub-areas, have ever been assigned
to a message.

If the area has indeed been assigned to a message, the user should instead deactivate the area.

=== Importing and Exporting Areas

The administrator can export and import areas from the area action menu:

image::AreasActionMenu.png[Area Action Menu, 120]

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/area/vo/SystemAreaVo.java[SystemAreaVo]
class.
The data file should define root areas at the top level, and the recursively define sub-areas in the _children_
field of the parent area.

The imported data is merged into the existing area tree. If an MRN is defined for an imported area, this is used
to search for existing areas in the area tree. Alternatively, the name of the area (in all supported languages)
is used to search for existing matches.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "mrn": "urn:mrn:iho:country:dk",
    "active": true,
    "descs": [ { "name": "Danmark",  "lang": "da" }, { "name": "Denmark", "lang": "en" }
    ],
    "type": "COUNTRY",
    "geometry": {
      "type": "MultiPolygon",
      "coordinates": [ ... ]
    },
    "children": [
      {
        "active": true,
        "descs": [ { "name": "Østersøen", "lang": "da" }, { "name": "The Baltic Sea", "lang": "en" } ],
        "geometry": {
          "type": "MultiPolygon",
          "coordinates": [ ... ]
        },
        "children": [ ... ],
        "messageSorting": "CW",
        "originLatitude": 54.5,
        "originLongitude": 12.0,
        "originAngle": 180
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing an area JSON file will trigger the _area-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading an area import JSON file on the _Areas_ admin page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/area-import/in_ folder.
