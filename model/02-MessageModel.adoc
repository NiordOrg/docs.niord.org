== Niord Message Model
The Niord Message Model is the combined model used to represent Navigational Warnings (NW) and Notices to Mariners (NM).

The model is used as an interchange format when communicating NW and NM messages with the Niord Editing System
and compatible systems.

A public API for fetching Niord Message data from a test system can be found at the
https://niord.e-navigation.net/api.html#/messages[Niord alpha server].

=== Background
The structured NW-NM data of the Niord Message Model needs to cater for the requirement set out by the
specifications for MSI and NM T&P respectively, i.e. the relevant parts of:

* Joint IHO-IMO-WMO S-53 standard on Maritime Safety Information.
* IHO S-4 standard, which covers NM T&P.
* Revised NAVTEX Manual MSC Circular.
* IMO International SafetyNET manual.

The data model has been a further development of the work conducted in the EU-funded _ACCSEAS_ project, documented in:

* ACCSEAS WP6 MSI/NM (T&P) Service Description.

It has subsequently been updated according to the progress of the S-124 specification, an effort by IHO to
create an S-100 specification for Navigational Warnings (and possibly Notices to Mariners T&P).

=== Message Model UML
The UML diagram for the message model is given by:

[[img-message-uml]]
.Message UML Model
image::Message-Class-Diagram.png[Message UML Model, 80%, 80%, link="{imagesdir}/Message-Class-Diagram.png"]

The diagram uses the following colour codes:

* Light-gray background: Used for enumerations.
* Light-yellow background: Used for localized description entities - see _Design Pattern_ section below.
* Light-green background: The _GeoJSON_ model is detailed in the next chapter.

The use of aggregation vs composition connectors above is mostly academic, since the UML is not a
database model but merely an interchange format. However, the aggregation connector is used to signal
that the associated entity represents base data in the producing system, and is not tied to the
life cycle of the Message.

=== Design Patterns
The overarching idea has been to generalize the constituent parts and fields of NW and NM T&P messages,
and make the format both backwards compatible and future-proof by e.g. adding support for:

* *Multi-language support.* All messages must be localizable to any number of languages, including the base data
they reference (e.g. areas). The pattern adopted to support this, is to let all classes with localizable
attributes (such as Message) have an associated list of description entities (MessageDesc) which contains an
ISO 639-1 language code and the localizable fields. The description entities are yellow in the UML diagram below.
* *Rich text support.* NM’s in particular, can contain a rich layout containing features such as tables,
links, embedded pictograms, etc. By supporting HTML descriptions this can be accommodated.
* *New identifier format.* The S-4 and S-53 standards loosely specifies a numbering scheme for NWs and NMs.
However, the numbering scheme does not guarantee uniqueness in a combined NW-NM model, let alone a system
that may contain messages from multiple authorities. Thus, the NW-NM data model introduces the generalized
concept of message series used to group messages by.
* *Base data.* Part of a combined NW-NM model is to define a relationship between messages and base data
such as charts, categories and areas. Previous proposals have opted for rigid solutions with a fixed number
of area and category levels, and with enumerated category values.

The remainder of the chapter will detail the individual classes.

=== Message Model Classes
The remainder of the chapter will detail the individual classes.

==== MessageSeries
According to IHO, NW and NM messages must be numbered. For NW, it is e.g. mandated that:

[quote]
Navigational warnings in each series should be consecutively numbered throughout the calendar year,
commencing with 1/YY at 0000 UTC on 1 January.

The numbering scheme does not guarantee uniqueness in a combined NW-NM model, let alone a system
that may contain messages from multiple countries and authorities.
Thus, message series have been introduced in the NW-NM data model to group messages as appropriate.
A country may e.g. have separate message series for NW and NM. However, they may also introduce
separate message series to allow, say, local harbour authorities to maintain their own message series
for local NWs, or, as is the case with Canada, divide the country into five regions, each with their
own message series.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|seriesId|String|The ID of the message series in the implementing system. Should be globally unique.

|mainType|MainType|Either NW or NM.
|===

==== Chart
A message can be assigned a list of charts. The charts are maintained administratively as base data
in the producing system.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|chartNumber|String|Mandatory regional chart number (and identifier).

|internationalNumber|String|Optional international chart number.
|===

==== Area
Existing IHO standards for NW and NM both provide support for specifying multiple area levels
(_general area_ and _locality_ for NW; _general region_, _sub-region_ and _specific location_ for NMs).

However, in the NW-NM system, this has been generalized, and areas are administratively maintained
in a hierarchical area tree (with each area having a localized name) of arbitrary depth.
A message can be assigned a list of these areas, and by implication, the parent areas of the selected area.

Additionally, a message can be assigned a localized textual _vicinity_ description
(part of the <<MessageDesc>> class), for detailed location information not defined in the area tree.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|id|Int|Internal system ID of the area
|mrn|String|Optionally, an area may be assigned a globally unique MRN (maritime resource name). +
Adopting MRNs for areas would make interchange of message data between two NW-NM systems more robust.

|parent|Area|Non-root areas will reference their parent areas, and thus allow clients to e.g. group and sort
messages by areas +
Example: Randers Havn -> Kattegat -> Danmark

|descs|AreaDesc[]|The list of localizable attributes for an area. See <<AreaDesc>>
|===

TIP: Whereas clients may use message areas for e.g. grouping or filtering messages, there is no
reason to render the areas for the end user. The areas of a message will often be part of the message title already.

==== AreaDesc
The AreaDesc class contains the list of localizable attributes for an area.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|lang|String|The ISO 639-1 language code.

|name|String|The localized name of an area.
|===

==== Category
Categories are administratively maintained in a hierarchical category tree (with each category having
a localized name) of arbitrary depth. A message can be assigned a list of these categories,
and by implication, the parent categories of a selected category.

At the top level, the categories will have entries such as _Aids to Navigation_, _Drifting Objects_,
_Obstruction_, etc., which is the categorization used in the IHO standards. The sub-categories will
represent the types of hazard relevant to the parent category. Examples of category lineages (top-down):

* AtoN -> Floating AtoN -> Buoy -> Buoy Established
* AtoN -> Light -> Light Unlit
* Obstruction -> Diving Operation

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|id|Int|Internal system ID of the category

|mrn|String|Optionally, a category may be assigned a globally unique MRN (maritime resource name).
Adopting MRNs for categories would make interchange of message data between two NW-NM systems more robust.

|parent|Category|Non-root category will reference their parent categories.

|descs|CategoryDesc[]|The list of localizable attributes for a category. See <<CategoryDesc>>.
|===

TIP: The main purpose of categories is to allow for client filter and customized portrayal.
There is no reason to render the categories separately for the end user.

==== CategoryDesc
The _CategoryDesc_ class contains the list of localizable attributes for a category.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|lang|String|The ISO 639-1 language code.

|name|String|The localized name of a category.
|===

==== Reference
The Reference class provides a typed, weak reference to another message.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|messageId|String|An identifier of the referenced message. If the messageId is recognized to be a
_short-ID_ of another message, it can e.g. be used to hyperlink to that message.
However there are no requirements as to the format of the message ID.

|type|ReferenceType|The type of the reference. One of the values "reference", "repetition",
"repetition_new_time", "cancellation" or "update".

|descs|ReferenceDesc[]|The list of localizable attributes for a Reference. See <<ReferenceDesc>>.
|===

==== ReferenceDesc
The _ReferenceDesc_ class contains the list of localizable attributes for a reference.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|lang|String|The ISO 639-1 language code.

|description|String|The localized description of a reference.
|===

==== Attachment
Messages can be associated with a list of attachments, such as images, PDF-files, etc. The physical
attachment files will reside in a public repository on the producing system.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|type|String|The content type of the attachment file, such as "image/png".

|path|String|The URL path to the attachment file in the producing system.

|fileName|String|The file name of the attachment

|fileSize|Long|The size of the attachment in bytes

|display|AttachmentDisplayType|If defined, this flag can be used to signal how the editor intended
for the (image or video) attachment to be displayed when rendering the message for the end user.

"above" and "below" signals that the attachment should be displayed above, respectively below,
the message details. "separate_page" signals that the attachment should be displayed on a separate page
if rendered in paged media, such as a PDF file.

|width|String|The width to use when displaying the (image or video) attachment. The width must include
the type (i.e. _em, px, %, cm, mm, in, pt_ or _pc_). If the _height_ attribute is left
unspecified, the attachment should be scaled proportionally.

|height|String|The height to use when displaying the (image or video) attachment. The height must include
the type (i.e. _em, px, %, cm, mm, in, pt_ or _pc_). If the _width_ attribute is left
unspecified, the attachment should be scaled proportionally.

|descs|AttachmentDesc[]|The list of localizable attributes for an Attachment. See <<AttachmentDesc>>.
|===

TIP: If the client wish to work in offline mode, it should download all
attachments locally, and rewrite attachment paths accordingly. Also, since attachments may be
embedded as images or links in the HTML of the message part details field (see <<MessagePartDesc>>),
this field should be rewritten as well.

==== AttachmentDesc
The _AttachmentDesc_ class contains the list of localizable attributes for an attachment.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|lang|String|The ISO 639-1 language code.

|caption|String|A localized caption to display for the attachment.
|===

==== DateInterval
A message part will have an associated list of (possibly open-ended) event date intervals.
This defines the period of time for which the hazard described by the message part applies.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|allDay|Boolean|If the _allDay_ flag is set, the fromDate/toDate attributes should be treated as dates
without a time-part by the producing system.

|fromDate|DateTime|The start date-time of a date interval.

|toDate|DateTime|An optional end date-time of a date interval.
|===

TIP: Clients may use event dates for filtering messages (e.g. filter for relevance in route planning).
However, the client should not render the event dates for the end user, since a textual representation
of the dates should be included in the message part details (see <<MessagePartDesc>>).

==== MessagePart
A message defines an ordered list of _message parts_, which can be thought of as sub-stories.
Conceptually, each message part defines the time, positions, key subject and description of the hazard or event
that the story pertains to.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|indexNo|Int|Specified the ascending index of the message part within the message

|type|MessagePartType|May be used by the client to tag the message tag details with a type. Valid types
are "details", "time", "positions", "note", "prohibition" and "signals".

|geometry|GeoJSON|The positions of the message part. The GeoJSON type is treated in details in the
<<Niord GeoJSON Model>> chapter.

In practice, Niord will always return a _FeatureCollection_ GeoJSON entity.

|eventDates|DateTime[]|The list of event dates for which the message part hazard pertains. The list
should not be rendered for the end user by the client, but may be used for computations.

|descs|MessagePartDesc[]|The list of localizable attributes for a MessagePart. See <<MessagePartDesc>>.
|===

==== MessagePartDesc
The _MessagePartDesc_ class contains the list of localizable attributes for a message part.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute Name|Type|Description

|lang|String|The ISO 639-1 language code.

|subject|String|The key subject of the hazard or event that the message part pertains to.

|details|String|A detailed description of the hazard or event that the message part pertains to.

The type of the _details_ field is mandated to be HTML, and thus allows for fairly advanced layout
and typography, and may contain elements such as tables, links, images, etc.
|===

==== Message
The _Message_ class represents a complete _Navigational Warning_ (NW) or _Notices to Mariners_ (NM)
nautical information message.

It has been a deliberate choice to let NWs and NMs share the same _Message_ class, rather than having
a separate sub-class for each type.
The main rationale for this is that NWs and NMs T&P are expected to converge in the future, once promulgation
is handled completely via electronic means.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header"]
