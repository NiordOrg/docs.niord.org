== Webapp Coding Conventions

The other big chunk of code in Niord is the AngularJS and JavaScript-based web application.

=== Organization of Angular Sources

The web application is organized as follows:

image::WebAppStructure.png[Package Structure, 240]

All source files developed as part of Niord, is placed in the _app_ folder.
All external dependencies, such as third-party AngularJS directives, are placed in the _ext_ folder.

Under _app_, the angular sources, such as directives, controllers, services and partials (html),
are primarily organized by _main page_.
So, all sources for the _Messages_ page are in the _messages_ folder, etc.

=== Application Cache

The Niord web application use various HTML 5 features, such as _Local Storage_ and _Application Cache_.
The _Application Cache_ in particular, makes day-to-day use of Niord substantially faster for end users.

WARNING: Application Cache has supposedly been deprecated, and is to be replaced with a _Service Workers_
mechanism. However, Service Workers are not yet supported by Safari (read: iOS).

The niord-web project can be built using the "dist" profile:

    cd niord-web
    mvn -P dist clean install

This will perform the following modifications to the resulting war file:

* All Niord CSS and JavaScript files will be merged into single files.
* An HTML5 Application Cache manifest file is generated to facilitate caching.

=== Overlay Wars

Another mightily important feature used by Niord, is the web-application overlay mechanism.

In reality, the Niord project would not be used in production by itself.
Rather, developers would create a country-specific version (such as niord-dk for Denmark,
or niord-gh for Ghana) with all the customizations and legacy integration needed for that
particular country.

The main trick is to create a web application that functions as an _overlay_ of the Niord web application.
This allows the developer to selectively replace individual files, such as AngularJS files, CSS files,
resource bundles, etc.

The pom.xml file of the new web application, should define the overlay as:

[source,xml]
