== Introduction

* This version of the development guideline is for Niord 3.0. 
Niord 3.0 is based on the Quarkus framework and replaces Niord 2.0 which was based on Wildfly.

Niord (Nautical Information Directory) is a system for producing and publishing
Navigational Warnings (_NW_) and Notices to Mariners T&P (_NM_).

It was originally developed as part of the http://efficiensea2.org[EfficienSea2] EU project
and subsequently implemented as a production system for the
http://www.dma.dk/[Danish Maritime Authority].

This guide should be read by developers of Niord. It will use the Danish Niord system as a use case.
The guide will cover topics, such as coding conventions, how to set up a development environment, etc.

=== Developer Profile

For the development process to be effective, the developer should preferably have a thorough knowledge
of the following technologies:

* Java 21
* Jakarta EE: Niord uses the entire Jakarta EE stack, specially JPA, JAX-RS, Servlets, Batch API,
             CDI, etc.
* AngularJS + Bootstrap
* MySQL
* Docker

It would also be advantageous, if the developer has some knowledge of the following technologies:

* OpenLayers
* ActiveMQ Artemis
* Quarkus
* Keycloak
* Freemarker
* Maven
* Git(hub)

Furthermore, the actual Niord source code also has a certain learning curve.
