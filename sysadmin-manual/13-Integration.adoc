== Integration

By default, the _Integration_ sysadmin page is blank, and serves as a place-holder for system-specific
integration management pages.

Hence, this chapter will use the _Danish_ Niord system as an example for how to add integration functionality.
All functionality and UI resources for the Danish _Integration_ page is included in the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord-dk[niord-dk] Github project.

IMPORTANT: The functionality detailed in this chapter is specifically from the _Danish_ Niord system,
and thus, it is _not_ standard Niord functionality.

=== DK Legacy NW Import

The _Legacy NW Import_ integration tab will only be present when the currently selected domain is "Legacy NW".
It supports importing NWs from the current Danish NW production system (until Niord takes over this role
completely, that is).

The panel allows the system administrator to specify the target message series to use for local and
coastal legacy NW messages, and also to specify the date from which to import old legacy NW messages,
and whether to auto-import NW messages from the legacy system or not.

=== DK Legacy Firing Area Import

The _Legacy Firing Area Import_ integration tab will only be present when the currently selected domain
is "Firing Areas".
It supports importing firing areas from the current Danish NW production system (until Niord takes
over this role completely, that is).

The tab also supports importing the firing schedules associated with the firing areas from the legacy NW
system, and there is a function for generating firing area template messages from the firing areas.

Please refer to the <<Firing Schedules>> chapter for a discussion of firing areas and schedules in Niord.

=== DK Legacy AtoN Import

The _Legacy AtoN Import_ integration tab supports importing Danish Aids to Navigation seamarks.
The files to upload must be Excel sheets generated from the Danish _Afm√¶rkningsregister_ system.

Please note, the AtoNs Niord module is currently not enabled in production, since the quality of
the AtoN data is not good enough.
However, in the future it is hoped that a more extensive AtoN integration will be implemented.
