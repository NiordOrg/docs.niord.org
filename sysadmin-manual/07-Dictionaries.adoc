== Dictionaries

The _Dictionaries_ page allows a system administrator to manage the named dictionaries used in Niord.
The dictionaries contain translatable text used in the Niord website, in PDF reports, e-mails,
template parameter lists, etc.

The topmost menu is used to select the currently selected dictionary.

The sysadmin may filter the list of dictionary entries, displayed for the currently selected dictionary,
by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field.
The term is matched against the key of the dictionary entries.

=== Standard Dictionaries

Niord defines a set of standard dictionaries, that are initially loaded from _resource bundles_ in
the Niord distribution.
The standard dictionaries are:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Dictionary
| Description

| web
| The "web" dictionary contains much of the text actually displayed on the Niord website.

| message
| The "message" dictionary contains many of the terms used for NW and NM messages, and is used
  in the Niord website, PDF reports, e-mails, etc.

| mail
| The "mail" dictionary contains additional translatable terms used in e-mails.

| pdf
| The "pdf" dictionary contains additional translatable terms used in PDF reports.

| template
| The "template" dictionary contains additional translatable terms used when executing message templates.

|===

=== Extended Dictionaries

Niord also supports importing _extended dictionaries_, as detailed in the
<<Importing and Exporting Dictionaries>> section.

The entries of these dictionaries have an extra translatable _long value_ field, which can be
viewed and edited by checking the "Show Extended" option, next to the dictionary menu:

One such dictionary is the "aton" dictionary, which contain parameter list entries used in the
message template function - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
chapter.

=== Adding or Editing a Dictionary Entry

The sysadmin can add a new dictionary entry to the currently selected dictionary by clicking the
"New Entry" button, or edit an existing dictionary entry by clicking the pencil symbol next to the entry.

This will open the _Dictionary Entry Edit Page_:

The standard dictionary entry attributes:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Entry Attribute
| Description

| Key
| A unique key for the dictionary entry

| Values
| The textual values for all supported languages.

|===

For extended dictionaries - i.e. when the "Show Extended" option is checked - there are a
couple of additional attributes. These entries are typically used in parameter lists when executing
message templates - please refer to the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
chapter.

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Entry Attribute
| Description

| Long version
| A secondary version of the dictionary entry for all supported languages.

| AtoN filter
| The _AtoN_ filter is not currently used in production, but it ties in with the _Aids to Navigation_ module
  of Niord. There, you can start by selecting an AtoN and then execute a message template based on the AtoN
  data.
  The _AtoN filter_ attribute can be used to facilitate pre-selection of the correct parameters in the
  message templates. For instance, in the example above the "north cardinal buoy" entry matches AtoNs according
  to the filter: "aton.kv('seamark:buoy_cardinal:category', 'north') && !aton.k('seamark:light.*')".
  AtoNs are defined in an
  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Seamark_Objects[OpenStreetmap (OSM) Seamark] format, and thus,
  the filter states that the AtoN should be a north cardinal buoy, but not a light buoy.

=== Deleting a Dictionary Entry

A dictionary entry can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.

Be careful that the dictionary entry is not used in on of the <<Parameter Types>> definitions.

=== Importing and Exporting Dictionaries

The system administrator can export and import dictionaries from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/dictionary/vo/ExportedDictionaryVo.java[ExportedDictionaryVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "name": "mail",
    "entries": [
      {
        "descs": [
          {
            "lang": "da",
            "value": "K\u00e6re {0}"
          },
          {
            "lang": "en",
            "value": "Dear {0}"
          }
        ],
        "key": "mail.dear.user"
      },
      ...
    ],
  }
]
----

Importing a dictionary JSON file will trigger the _dictionary-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a _dictionary import JSON file on the _Dictionaries_ sysadmin page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/dictionary-import/in_ folder.

=== Reloading Standard Dictionaries

As mentioned in the <<Standard Dictionaries>> section, the standard dictionaries are initially loaded from
_resource bundles_ in the Niord distribution.

These dictionaries can be re-loaded from the resource bundles by enacting the "Reload from system"
function in the action menu.
