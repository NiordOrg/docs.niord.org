== Categories

The _Categories_ page allows a system administrator to manage the the hierarchical tree of
categories in Niord.
Lists of categories may be associated with notices to mariners and navigational warnings,
and can be used for filtering message search results.

Furthermore, categories may be executable, in which case they can be used to generate messages
from user input, as described in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
chapter.
Hence, executable categories are synonymously known as _message templates_, or just _templates_,
throughout the Niord documentation.

The category tree is navigated like a file system directory.
Additionally, the user may filter the categories by typing a term into the _Filter Categories_ input field
above the category tree. The term is matched against the name of the categories.

=== Adding or Editing a Category

The user can add a new category by clicking the "Add" button, or edit a category by selecting it in
the category tree.

When adding a new category, it will be a child-category of the currently selected category in the
category tree. If no category is selected, the new category will become a new root category.

The details of the new or edited category will be present in the _Category Editor Panel_ next to the
category tree (see screenshot above).

The common editable attributes for both types of categories are listed below:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Category Attribute
| Description

| Active
| Only an active category can be assigned to a message or executed as a message template.

| Name
| The name of the category in all supported model languages.

| MRN
| Optionally, specify a _Maritime Resource Name_ (a unique URN) for the category. Defining MRNs for
  categories will facilitate better integration between Niord systems of different countries.

| Additional Editor Fields
| Can be used to enable extra fields in the message editor when the category is assigned to the message.
  As an example, if a "Firing Exercises" category is assigned to a navigational warning, it might make
  sense to show the "Signals" editor field, not normally enabled for navigational warnings, in the
  message editor.

| AtoN filter
| The _AtoN_ filter is not currently used in production, but it ties in with the _Aids to Navigation_ module
  of Niord. There, you can start by selecting an AtoN and then execute a message template based on the AtoN
  data.
  The _AtoN filter_ category attribute can be used to filter which templates should be available for
  a given AtoN. For instance, in the example above the "Light Buoy" category and all its sub-categories,
  are only availble to AtoNs matching the filter:
  "aton.kv(''seamark:type'', ''buoy.\*'') && aton.k(''seamark:light.*'')".

  AtoNs are defined in an
  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Seamark_Objects[OpenStreetMap (OSM) Seamark] format, and thus,
  the filter states that the AtoN should be of type "buoy" and also have an associated light.

| Type
| Optionally, specify the category type. Currently, "Category" and "Template" are the only supported types.
  A Category of the "Category" type has no more attributes. However, a "Template" category has a few
  more attributes detailed in the next section.

|===

=== Adding or Editing a Template

A category of type "Template" is _executable_, as described in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
chapter.

This section will detail the attributes that may be edited for templates in addition to the common
attributes editable for all categories and detailed in the previous section.

==== Domains Attribute

Most of the executable templates only really make sense for Navigational Warnings (NW), not e.g.
Notices to Mariners (NM), since NWs tend to be short and concise and must follow various international
standards. NMs on the other hand, tend to be more _free style_ messages, not easily handled by
a template system.

The _Domains_ attribute can thus be used to restrict templates to specific NW-related domains.

==== Standard Template Fields Attribute

The _Standard Template Fields_ attributes can be use to specify a list of standard template
editor fields, which mostly constitutes simplified versions of the corresponding message editor
fields - see the http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#edit-editor-page[Editor Page] chapter.
The supported template fields are:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Template Field
| Description

| type
| Used for selecting the NW or NM sub-type of the message.

| promulgation
| Used for enabling and disabling the supported promulgation types.

| id
| Can be used for selecting the message series of a message.

| publish_date
| Allows the user to specify a publication date interval.

| areas
| Used to specify the areas and vicinity of the messages.

| positions
| Used for defining the positions of the message.

| event_dates
| Allows the user to specify a list of event date intervals.

| work_vessel
| Used for specifying work vessels, e.g. for cable operations.

| markings
| Used for specifying a list of markings, e.g. used for marking a wreck.

|===

As an example, the "light buoy unlit" message template displays the "type", "promulgation",
"areas" and "positions" standard template fields:

==== Template Parameters Attribute

For most message templates, just using _standard template fields_ for user input is not sufficient.
Rather, the user executing the template will need to input template-specific data as well,
such as the buoy function in the "Light buoy unlit" template.

The _Template Parameters_ field is used for defining the additional parameters of a template.
The field defines of a list of parameters, using the _Parameter Types_ defined on the
<<Parameter Types>> sysadmin page.
Indeed, defining the parameters is analogous to the way _composite_ parameter types are defined, as
detailed in the http://docs.niord.org/sysadmin-manual/manual.html#composite-parameter-type-edit-page[Composite Parameter Type Edit Page].

As an example, the "light buoy unlit" message template use the "light_buoy_by_function" _composite_
parameter type to query the end user about the light buoy function and name:

image::CategoryTemplateParams.png[Category Template Parameters, 800]

==== Script Resources Attribute

The _Script Resources_ attribute is used to define the actual list of script resources, i.e.
server-side JavaScript and Freemarker templates, that get executed, when a message template
is run.

The functionality of _script resources_ is detailed in the <<Script Resources>> chapter.
The Freemarker templates are used to generate an <<Intermediate Message Template Format>> that defines
how a message is constructed when a message template is executed.
The JavaScript resources can be used to modify data. In the "Light buoy unlit" example, a
"compute-affected-radius.js" script is run, that will attempt to add an affected radius to the
geometry of the constructed message based on the range to the light (only works if the message template
is run from the AtoN module page).

The path specified for a script resource must match an actual script resource defined on the
<<Script Resources>> sysadmin page.
Indeed, clicking the pencil button of the _script resource_ input field will open the specified script
resource for editing on the <<Script Resources>> page.
Clicking the magnifying glass button will open a dialog for easy script resource selection.
Clicking the plus-sign button will add another blank script resource field to the list, and clicking
the trash-icon button will clear the script resource path.
Finally, the order of execution can be controlled by dragging a script resource its proper position using
the image:DragHandle.png[Drag Handle, 16] drag handle.

==== Example Template Message Attribute

With a large collection of message template, it may not be easy for a non-expert user to guess
which template to execute in a particular situation.

The system administrator can define an _example template message_ to each template, to aid the user.
This message will be displayed for guidance, whenever the template is selected in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#template-selection-dialog[Template Selection Dialog].

=== Reorganizing Categories

The hierarchical order of the categories are updated in two ways:

* To move a category to a different parent category, use drag-and-drop.
* To move a category to another position under the same parent category, use the up- and
  down-arrow buttons above the category tree.

=== Deleting a Category

A category, including all its sub-categories, can be deleted by selecting it and then click the
"Delete" button above the category tree.
However, this only works if neither the selected category, nor any of its sub-categories, have ever
been assigned to a message.

If the category has indeed been assigned to a message, the user should instead deactivate the category.

=== Importing and Exporting Categories

The administrator can export and import categories from the category action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/category/vo/SystemCategoryVo.java[SystemCategoryVo]
class.
The data file should define root categories at the top level, and the recursively define sub-categories
in the _children_ field of the parent category.

The imported data is merged into the existing category tree. If an MRN is defined for an imported category,
this is used to search for existing categories in the category tree. Alternatively, the name of the category
(in all supported languages)
is used to search for existing matches.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "active": true,
    "descs": [
      { "name": "Fyr", "lang": "da" },
      { "name": "Light", "lang": "en" }
    ],
    "type": "CATEGORY",
    "atonFilter": "aton.kv('seamark:type', 'light.*')",
    "children": [
      {
        "active": true,
        "descs": [
          { "name": "Fyr slukket", "lang": "da" },
          { "name": "Light unlit", "lang": "en" }
        ],
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "siblingSortOrder": 0.0,
        "domains": [
          { "domainId": "niord-nw", }
        ],
        "stdTemplateFields": [
          "areas",
          "type",
          "promulgation",
          "positions"
        ],
        "templateParams": [
          {
            "paramId": "aton",
            "type": "light",
            "mandatory": false,
            "positionList": true,
            "descs": [
              { "name": "Fyr", "lang": "da" },
              { "name": "Light", "lang": "en" }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "scriptResourcePaths": [
          "templates/tmpl/light-unlit.ftl",
          "templates/tmpl/compute-affected-radius.js"
        ],
        "messageId": "NW-003-17"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]

Importing a category JSON file will trigger the _category-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a category import JSON file on the _Categories_ admin page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/category-import/in_ folder.
