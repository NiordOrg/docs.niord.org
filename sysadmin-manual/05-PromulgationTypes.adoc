== Promulgation Types

The _Promulgation Types_ page allows a system administrator to manage the list of promulgation types
in Niord.

For Navigational Warnings in particular, there may be a need to promulgate specialized versions of
a message to external channels.
Niord has a plug-in architecture for adding new promulgation types. By default, it supports
distributing _NAVTEX_ versions of navigational warnings via mailing lists, and support for posting
messages at Twitter upon publication.

Furthermore, the Danish version of Niord supports generating an _Audio_ promulgation for
navigational warnings. This will promulgate a verbose textual version of the messages,
suitable to be read up on radio by non-maritime personal, to a mailing list.

The integration of promulgation types in the message editor is detailed in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#promulgation-editor-field[Promulgation Editor Field]
chapter of the Editors Manual.

=== Adding or Editing a Promulgation Type

The sysadmin can add a new instance of a promulgation type by clicking the "Add Promulgation Type" button,
which will allow the sysadmin to select which promulgation type to add:

Similarly, an existing promulgation type can be edited by clicking the pencil symbol next to the
promulgation type.

Adding or editing a promulgation type will open the _Promulgation Type Edit Page_:

All editable attributes, except the bottom-most one, are common to all promulgation types:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Promulgation Type Attribute
| Description

| Active
| Only active promulgation types are used when creating a new message.

| Promulgate by Default
| Use this checkbox to flag if the promulgation type should be turned on by default for qualifying
  messages.

| Type ID
| The unique ID of the promulgation type.

| Name
| The name of the promulgation type.

| Priority
| The sort order of the promulgation type in the message editor.

| Language
| Some promulgation types may be tied to one of the message model languages. For instance, the
  _NAVTEX_ promulgation type should always be tied to English.

| Domains
| The list of domains for which the promulgation type will be included in the message editor.

| Restrict Types
| Depending on the _Domains_ selection above, the messages that will be assigned promulgations
  of the promulgation type can be either _NW_ (navigational warnings) or _NM_ (notices to mariners),
  or both. The _Restrict Types_ field will allow the sysadmin to restrict the promulgation type
  to a selection of _NW_ or _NM_ sub-types.
  As an example, _NAVTEX_ should be associated with _Coastal Warnings_, not _Local Warnings_.

| Script Resource Paths
| Optionally, the sysadmin can specify one or more script resources that will be enacted when
  an editor chooses to generate promulgations by executing message templates.
  As an example, the _NAVTEX_ promulgation type runs a Freemarker script that adds the
  currently selected message area as a preamble NAVTEX line.
  Script Resources is an advanced topic detailed in the <<Script Resources>> chapter.

==== Promulgation Type Specific Editor Fields

Each promulgation type may have custom editor fields at the bottom of the _Promulgation Type Edit Page_.
This may be used for editing promulgation type-specific settings.

===== NAVTEX
The NAVTEX promulgation type has a button for managing the available transmitters (NAVTEX stations).
Clicking the button will open the _Transmitters_ dialog:

image::NavtexTransmitterDialog.png[NAVTEX Transmitter Dialog, 400]

For each transmitter added via this dialog, the sysadmin can specify which areas the transmitter covers.
This will facility automatic selection of the correct transmitters when a new message is created
by executing a message template.

===== Twitter Settings
The Twitter promulgation type has an "Update Settings" button that opens a dialog used for managing the
format of the generated tweets, and the OAuth credential used when submitting a tweet to Twitter:

image:TwitterSettingsDialog.png[Twitter Settings Dialog, 400]

The _Format_ field may contain _replacement tokens_ such as "${short-id}", "${tweet}" "${base-uri}"
and "${uid}". The tokens will be replaced with real values when a message is published.

As a example, the format "${short-id} ${tweet} ${base-uri}/#/message/${uid}" will generate a tweet
similar to the example below, that contains the message short id, the actual message-specific tweet
(title line of the message), and a link to open the full message in Niord:

image:Tweet.png[Tweet, 300]

When the _Thumbnail_ option is turned on, as in the example above, a thumbnail image will be generated
and submitted with the tweet.

The _API Key_ and _Access Token_ fields must be filled out with the corresponding values defined at
https://apps.twitter.com.

=== Deleting a Promulgation Type

A promulgation type can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.
However, this only works if there is not related data associated with the promulgation type.

Instead the system administrator can choose to in-activate the promulgation type.


=== Importing and Exporting Promulgation Types

The system administrator can export and import promulgation types from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/promulgation/vo/PromulgationTypeVo.java[PromulgationTypeVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "active": true,
    "domains": [
    	{ "domainId": "niord-client-nw" }
    ],
    "language": "en",
    "messageTypes": [
      "COASTAL_WARNING"
    ],
    "name": "NAVTEX",
    "priority": 1,
    "promulgateByDefault": false,
    "scriptResourcePaths": [
      "templates/tmpl/navtex.ftl"
    ],
    "serviceId": "navtex",
    "typeId": "navtex"
  },
  ...
]
----

Please note, this data format does _not_ include support for the promulgation type-specific attributes
such as the NAVTEX transmitters. These attributes must be handled manually.

Importing a promulgation type JSON file will trigger the _promulgation-type-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a promulgation type import JSON file on the _Promulgation Types_
sysadmin page, the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/promulgation-type-import/in_ folder.
