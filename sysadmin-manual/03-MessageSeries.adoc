== Message Series

The _Message Series_ page allows a system administrator to manage the list of message series used
throughout Niord.
A message series define the types of messages that can be assigned to the message. It also defines how
messages are numbered and the format of their IDs.

The sysadmin may filter the list of message series by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field above the
message series list. The term is matched against the ID of the message series.

=== Adding or Editing a Message Series

The sysadmin can add a new message series by clicking the "New Message Series" button, or edit an existing
message series by clicking the pencil symbol next to the series.

This will open the _Message Series Edit Page_:

The message series attributes:

|===
| Series Attribute
| Description

| Message Series ID
| A unique ID for the message series. Should be globally unique.

| Main Type
| The main type, i.e. _Navigational Warnings_ or _Notices to Mariners_, of the messages assigned to the
  message series.

| Type
| Optionally, the sysadmin may specify the specific types (sub-types of the main type) of the messages
  assigned to the message series.
  If the current main type is _Navigational Warnings_, the possible types include _Local_, _Coastal_,
  _Subarea_ and _Navarea_. If the main type is _Notices to Mariners_, the possible types include
  _Preliminary_, _Temporary_, _Permanent_ and _Miscellaneous_.
  If none of the types have been selected, all types are valid for the given messages series.

| Number Sequence Type
| The _Number Sequence Type_ defines how numbers get assigned (or not) to a message when the message
  is published.
  If the type is _Yearly_, the first message published every year will be assigned the number "1",
  and subsequent message will be numbered consecutively from that.
  If the type is _Continuous_, the first message published will be assigned the number "1",
  and subsequent message will be numbered consecutively from that.
  If the type is _Manual_, the editor will get to assign a number manually to a message in the message
  editor. Please refer to the http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#id-editor-field[Editor Guide].
  If the type is _None_, no number will be assigned to the messages belonging to this message series.

| Short Format
| The _Short Format_ attribute defines the format of the _short ID_ that gets assigned to a message
  upon publication (except if the _Number Sequence Type_ is _None_).
  The format will typically contain _replacement tokens_ that gets substituted with real values.
  Valid _replacement tokens_ can be inserted into the field via the _insert_ menu, and include tokens
  such as "${number}", "${number-3-digits}", "${year}", "${year-2-digits}", etc.

| Next Number
| The _Next number_ field allows the sysadmin to manually specify the next number to assign to a
  message upon publication. This can be used for all message series with a _Number Sequence Type_ of
  _Yearly_ or _Continuous_.

| Additional Editor Fields
| As described in the http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#editor[Editors Manual],
  the set of _editor fields_ used by default when editing a message depends on e.g. the main
  type of the message, the category, etc.
  It is also possible to enable non-standard editor fields per message series using the
  _Additional Editor Field_. As an example, if a message series is used exclusively for firing
  exercise navigational warnings, the sysadmin could enable the "Signals" editor field for that
  message series.

| NAVTEX Preamble
| The _NAVTEX Preamble_ field is only enabled for Navigational Warnings-related message series.
  It allows for the specification of a standardized NAVTEX preamble to be used for NAVTEX
  promulgations associated with the message. Please refer to the
  http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#promulgation-editor-field[Editors Guide] about
  promulgations.

=== Deleting a Message Series

A message series can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.
However, this only works if the message series being deleted has never been assigned to a message.

If a message series has indeed been assigned to a message, the sysadmin should instead remove
the message series from the relevant domain.
