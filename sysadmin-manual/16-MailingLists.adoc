== Mailing Lists

The _Mailing Lists_ page allows a system administrator to manage the mailing lists of Niord.

IMPORTANT: The _Mailing Lists_ page is actually placed under the _Admin_ main menu page.
This is because mere administrators can manage mailing list subscriptions, but not create or modify the
mailing lists themselves. Hence, mailing list subscription is detailed in the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#mailing-lists[Mailing Lists] chapter of the
administrator manual.

When a system administrator accesses the _Mailing Lists_ page, it has the following functionality:

=== Managing Mailing List Recipients

As mentioned above, subscription of the mailing lists is detailed in the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#mailing-lists[Mailing Lists] chapter of the
administrator manual.

=== Adding or Editing a Mailing List

The sysadmin can add a new mailing list by clicking the "New mailing list" button, or edit an existing
mailing list by clicking the pencil symbol next to the mailing list.

This will open the _Mailing List Edit Page_:

The basic mailing list attributes:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Mailing List Attribute
| Description

| Mailing List ID
| A unique ID for the mailing list.

| Active
| Only active mailing lists will actually execute and send out mails.

| Name
| A human readable name of the mailing list in all supported languages.

| Description
| A human readable description of the mailing list in all supported languages.

|===

Mailing list triggers are described separately below.

==== Mailing List Triggers

Mailing lists should be associated with one or more _mailing list triggers_. The triggers define
the criteria that will cause the mailing list to execute, and they define the format of the
actual  mails.

A new trigger is added by clicking the "Add Trigger" button. Similarly, a trigger is edited by clicking
the "Show Details" button in the trigger bar, and deleted again by clicking the "Delete" button.

The common trigger attributes are:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Trigger Attribute
| Description

| Trigger Type
| A trigger can either be a _Scheduled Triggers_ or a _Status Change Triggers_.
  These types are described in more detail below.

| Mail Subject
| The subject used for the mails being sent in all supported languages.
  Each subject field has a checkbox to enable or disable that particular language variant.
  The subject can contain _replacement tokens_ such as "${short-id}" and "${number-year-id}"
  (for status driven - i.e. single message - mails).

| Mail Body
| The list of script resources used for generating the mail HTML body. Typically, this will be
  a single Freemarker template. However, the list might also contain a JavaScript for looking up
  additional data used in the mail.

|===

===== Scheduled Triggers

The scheduled triggers will execute periodically, and base their generated mails on a list of messages
matching a certain message query.

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Trigger Attribute
| Description

| Schedule
| The schedule for when a trigger is executed. Either daily or a specific weekday, at a certain time.

| Message Query
| The _Message Query_ will be used as a filter for the list of messages passed along as data to the
  script resources.
  The example above will fetch all published coastal navigational warnings of the "dma-nw" message series,
  that also have an associated "audio" promulgation.

| Public Report
| If this option is checked the mailing list trigger can also be executed (with no mails generated) as
  a report in the action menu of the _Messages_ page - please refer to the
  http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#report-action[Report Action] chapter.

|===

===== Status Change Triggers

image::MailingListStatusChangeTrigger.png[Status Change Mailing List Trigger, 600]

The status change triggers will execute whenever a message changes status in Niord, and if the
updated message matches the specified status and filter, it will cause the mailing list to send mails.

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Trigger Attribute
| Description

| Statuses
| The new status of the messages that will cause the trigger to execute.

| Message Filter
| The _Message Filter_ defines an additional filter that the message must match, before the trigger
  executes. The filter is strictly speaking a server-side JavaScript expression.
  The example above will match coastal navigational warnings that are published and whose message series
  is "dma-nw".

|===

==== Testing Triggers

All mailing list triggers can be tested by clicking the "Test" button in the trigger bar.
This opens the _Test Trigger Execution_ dialog:

image::MailingListTest.png[Mailing List Test, 600]

For status-change triggers, the system administrator must also specify the short ID of the message
to test the trigger with.

Upon clicking the "Execute" button, the mailing list trigger will be executed, but no mails are
actually sent out. Instead the dialog will list all generated mails, and, upon selecting one of
these mails, the contents will be displayed in the dialog.

=== Deleting a Mailing List

A mailing list can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.

As an alternative, the system administrator can choose to in-activate the mailing list.


=== Importing and Exporting Mailing List

The system administrator can export and import mailing lists from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/mailinglist/vo/MailingListVo.java[MailingListVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "mailingListId": "audio-broadcast",
    "active": false,
    "descs": [
      {
        "lang": "da",
        "name": "Farvandsefterretninger til oplæsning",
        "description": "Farvandsefterretninger og skydeøvelser til oplæsning på DR"
      },
      {
        "lang": "en",
        "name": "Navigational Warnings for Voice Broadcast",
        "description": "Navigational Warnings and Firing Exercises for voice broadcast on Danish Radio"
      }
    ],
    "triggers": [
      {
        "type": "SCHEDULED",
        "scheduleType": "DAILY",
        "scheduledExecutionTime":"15:55",
        "scheduledExecutionTimeZone":"Europe/Copenhagen",
        "messageQuery": "messageSeries=dma-nw&messageSeries=dma-nw-local&status=PUBLISHED&promulgationType=audio",
        "scriptResourcePaths": [
          "templates/mailinglist/fetch-firing-exercises.js",
          "templates/mailinglist/audio-broadcast.ftl"
        ],
        "descs": [
          {
            "lang": "da",
            "subject": "Farvandsefterretninger til oplæsning ${date-short}"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing a mailing list JSON file will trigger the _mailing-list-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a mailing list import JSON file on the _Mailing Lists_ sysadmin
page, the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/mailing-list-import/in_ folder.
