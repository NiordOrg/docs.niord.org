== Mail Queue

The _Mail Queue_ page allows a system administrator to inspect all mails sent by the Niord system.

Mails in Niord originate from a few places:

. Users can send mails based on a message selection on the _Messages_ page. Please refer to the
  http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#e-mail-selection-action[E-mail Selection Action] chapter.
. Similarly, when a user submits a new comment to a message, they can add mail recipients, as described in
  the http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#comments-editor-page[Comments Editor Page] chapter.
. By far, the most mails will have been sent by mailing lists, as described in the
  http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#mailing-lists[Mailing Lists] chapter.

Niord has a system setting, "mailDeleteAfterDays", that defines for how many days a message should be
preserved in the _Mail Queue_. After that, the mails will be deleted.

=== Sending Mails

When a mail is submitted to the mail queue, it will have a _pending_ status. Every minute, Niord will
process pending mails and attempt to send them.
If a mail is successfully sent to the SMTP-server, it will be assigned the _sent_ status.
If an error occurs, however, the error message will be stored in the mail, and it will be re-scheduled
to be sent after a set number of minutes (which increases with each attempt).
After 5 failed attempts to send a mail, it will be be assigned the _error_ status, after which,
no more attempts will be made to send the mail.

A system administrator should thus periodically check for error-status mails in the _Mail Queue_, and
take appropriate actions (such as updating an invalid user mail address, etc).

=== Mail Filtering

The mail queue may contain thousands of mails. Hence the list of mails is paginated with 10 mails
per page.

The fields above the mail list are used for filtering the mail list. The available filter fields are:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Mail Filter
| Description

| Recipient
| Matches the e-mail address of the recipients

| Sender
| Matches the e-mail address of the sender

| Subject
| Matches the subject of the mails

| Status
| Filters the mails by their status, either _pending_, _sent_ or _error_ (or all of these).

| Date Interval
| A possibly open-ended date-interval that can be used to filter mails by the date they
  were submitted to the mail queue.

=== Mail Details

Clicking the letter-icon next to a mail, will open the _Mail Details_ dialog:

This will display the mail in its entirety, including the date, address fields, subject and mail body.
