== Print Reports

The _Print Reports_ page allows a system administrator to manage the list of PDF print reports in Niord.

image::PrintReportsPage.png[Print Reports Page, 800]

The sysadmin may filter the list of print reports by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field above the
print report list. The term is matched against the ID and name of the print reports.

Whenever a user selects to print a list of messages, as described in the
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#print-messages[Print Action] chapter of the editors manual,
she gets to chose which _Print Report_ to use.

The available list of print reports are domain specific, and each print report may query the end user
for a list of input parameters, such as the "Week" and "Year" for the "NM Report" above.
These parameters may in turn be used on the generated PDF, as demonstrated below:

=== Standard Reports

Niord will always ensure the availability of two standard reports available to all domains.

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Standard Report
| Description

| Standard
| The _Standard_ report prints out the details of the current message list in the currently
  selected language. It also sports a front page with a _Table of Contents_ section and
  information about the currently applied message filter.

| Draft
| The _Draft_ report is similar to the _Standard_ report, except that it includes all language
  versions of each message, and a few extra fields like message _type_ and _status_ that are not normally
  included. This makes the _Draft_ report very usable for proof-reading messages.

=== Generating PDFs

Generating PDFs using print reports is actually a two-phase process. First, the Freemarker template
associated with the print report is used to convert a list of message into a HTML representation.
Then, the HTML is converted into a PDF and returned to the user.

When creating and editing print reports, is important to understand how _CSS Paged Media_ can be
used to control such things as page size, pagination, headers and footers in the resulting PDF.
Thus, the sysadmin is advised to acquaint herself with relevant documentation, such as:

* https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/ - CSS Paged Media specification.
* https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/designing-for-print-with-css/ - Introduction to using paged media.

=== Adding or Editing a Print Report

The sysadmin can add a new print report by clicking the "New Report" button, or edit an existing
print report by clicking the pencil symbol next to the domain.

This will open the _Print Report Edit Page_:

The print report attributes:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Report Attribute
| Description

| Report ID
| A unique ID for the report.

| Name
| A human readable name of the report.

| Sort Order
| Defines the order of the print reports as used in the Print Dialog.

| Template
| The Freemarker template used to generate HTML. The specified path must be the path of an existing
  script resource, as defined in the <<Script Resources>> chapter.
  Clicking the pencil button next to the path input field will indeed open the report on the
  <<Script Resources>> sysadmin page. Clicking the magnifying glass icon will open a dialog for
  easy script resource selection.

| Domains
| The domains for which the print report will be made available.

| Read-only Properties
| A JSON property object that may be used in the Freemarker template. In the "NM Report" example
  screenshots above, the "volume" value, "133", and "ISSN" value, "1397-999X", come from these
  read-only properties.

| Parameters
| The _Parameters_ field is exactly like the _Read-only Properties_, except that the properties will
  be displayed in the Print dialog, and may thus be edited by the user per print.
  The _Parameter_ values may be instantiated with default values containing _replacement tokens_, such
  as "${year-2-digits}", "${year}", "${week-2-digits}" and "${week}".
  In the "NM Report" example screenshots above, the effect of specifying "week" and "year" parameters
  can be seen.

| Test
| The _Test_ field is not actually a print report attribute. The sysadmin can specify a message tag
  and test-execute the print report in this section.

=== Deleting a Print Report

A print report can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.

=== Importing and Exporting Print Reports

The system administrator can export and import print reports from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/report/vo/FmReportVo.java[FmReportVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "reportId": "nm-report",
    "name": "NM report",
    "sortOrder": 2,
    "templatePath": "templates/messages/nm-report-pdf.ftl",
    "domains": [
      { "domainId": "niord-nm" }
    ],
    "properties": {
      "mapThumbnails": false,
      "ISSN": "1397-999X",
      "volume": "133"
    },
    "params": {
      "week": "${week}",
      "year": "${year}"
    }
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing a print report JSON file will trigger the _report-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a report import JSON file on the _Print Reports_ sysadmin page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/report-import/in_ folder.
