== Script Resources

The _Script Resources_ page allows a system administrator to manage the list of _script resources_
in Niord.

image::ScriptResourcesPage.png[Script Resources, 800]

Script resources are always associated with a path, and come in two flavours; _Freemarker templates_
(with an ".ftl" path extension) and server-side Nashorn _JavaScript_ files (with a ".js" path extension).

System administrators wishing to work with script resources, should acquaint themselves with these
technologies, which are detailed further in the <<Server-Side JavaScript>> and <<Freemarker Templates>>
sections.

The Freemarker templates are typically, but not exclusively, used for generating HTML, whereas the
server-side JavaScript files are typically used for looking up or manipulating data.

The _Script Resources Page_ displays the list of script resources currently persisted to the database.
The system administrator can type a term into the _Filter_ input field above the list, to filter
the script resources by their paths.

=== Script Resource Usage

The script resources are used throughout Niord for operations such as generating PDF print reports,
generating mails, etc. An overview of functions using script resources is found in the table below:

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Function
| Description

| Print Reports
| Print Reports are maintained on the <<Print Reports>> sysadmin page. There are a couple of standard
  and draft reports, along with domain-specific reports, such as the weekly Notices to Mariners digest.
  In order to generate PDF files, Niord will first use Freemarker templates to generate HTML, and then
  convert the HTML into PDF (CSS 2 has extensions for _paged media_).
  Print Report Freemarker templates are typically found under the "templates/messages/" sub-path.

| Message Templates
| The single most extensive usage of script resources is for _Message Templates_ -  please refer to
  the subsequent <<Intermediate Message Template Format>> section.
  Message Templates use JavaScript file for data-manipulation and Freemarker templates for generating
  an intermediate template XML-format, used for generating messages.
  Message Template script resources are typically found under the "templates/tmpl/" sub-path.

| Mailing Lists
| Mailing lists also use script resources for generating the actual HTML e-mails - please refer to the
  <<Mailing Lists>> chapter.
  Mailing List script resources are typically found under the "templates/mailinglist/" sub-path.

| Miscellaneous
| Freemarker templates are used for quite a few discrete functions, such as formatting a light
  character (e.g. "Al.Bu.Y 3s") as human text, and formatting message positions in various formats
  - please see the http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#insert-locations[Insert Locations]
  section of the Editors manual.

=== Script Resource Extensions

Niord has added some extensions to both types of the script resources.

Firstly, the script resources are _always_ loaded from the database, not the file system.
However, if a script resource, as given by its path, does not exist in the database, then
Niord will check to see if the resource can be loaded from the class-path and persisted
to the database, thence commencing operations.

This means that Niord developers can develop and maintain the initial batch of script resources
as project files and use a professional code editor for editing the scripts.

Another Niord extension has to do with _script resource inclusion_. File system-based Freemarker Templates
can  include other Freemarker templates, and similarly for JavaScript files; a trait that facilitates
code reuse and libraries.
Niord has extended the _script resource inclusion_ concept, so that it works with the database-backed
scripts as well. Subsequent sections will give examples of script resource inclusion.

=== Server-Side JavaScript

An introduction to Nashorn JavaScript can be found at
http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/04/05/java8-nashorn-tutorial/.

The scripts are executed server-side, which means that you can e.g. call Java Enterprise Beans and
load and manipulate data.

WARNING: Executing JavaScripts server-side is clearly a security issue, since you can e.g. create
a script that deletes data. However, all access to create and update JavaScripts is strictly
restricted to system administrators, a role reserved to the person(s) that set up and configure
the entire system, and who can wreck it anyway, should they so decide...

The following example illustrates how to perform a message search for published firing exercises:

[source,javascript]
----
var messageService = CdiUtils.getBean(org.niord.core.message.MessageService.class);
var seriesIds = java.util.Collections.singleton('dma-fe');
var statuses = java.util.Collections.singleton(org.niord.model.message.Status.PUBLISHED);
var searchParams = new org.niord.core.message.MessageSearchParams();
searchParams.seriesIds(seriesIds)
    .statuses(statuses);
var searchResult = messageService.search(searchParams);
----

==== Inclusion in JavaScript

As mentioned in the <<Script Resource Extensions>> section, JavaScript files are persisted in the
database, and may include other JavaScript files.

Hence, the "templates/tmpl/common.js" JavaScript file contains a collection of common JavaScript functions
which is often included by other JavaScript files using the syntax:

[source,javascript]
----
/** Always load using full path and a "niord:" prefix **/
load('niord:templates/tmpl/common.js');
----

=== Freemarker Templates

The documentation for Freemarker templates are found at http://freemarker.org.

The Freemarker Templates are typically used to convert a data model, such as a message list,
into HTML, and sometimes into plain text or XML.

The following simple example, "templates/geometry/text.ftl", is instantiated with a "geometry"
(position list) and a "format", and formats the positions as a comma-separated list of lat-lon positions.

[source,xml]
----
<#assign formatPos = "org.niord.core.script.directive.LatLonDirective"?new()>

<#if geometry?has_content>
    <#list geometry as feature>
        <#if feature.coordinates?has_content>
            <#list feature.coordinates as coord>
                <@formatPos lat=coord.coordinates[1] lon=coord.coordinates[0] format=format />
                <#if coord?has_next>,&nbsp;</#if>
            </#list>
        </#if>
        <#if feature?has_next>,&nbsp;</#if>
    </#list>
</#if>
----

==== Inclusion in Freemarker Templates

As mentioned in the <<Script Resource Extensions>> section, Freemarker templates are persisted in the
database, and may include other Freemarker templates.

Hence, the "templates/tmpl/common.ftl" and "templates/messages/message-support.ftl" Freemarker templates
contain a collection of common Freemarker functions and macros used by other Freemarker templates,
using the syntax:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- From same path level -->
<#include "common.ftl"/>

<!-- Include from a different path level -->
<#include "../tmpl/common.ftl"/>
----

==== Language-Specific Freemarker Templates

When loading the main Freemarker template path, or any of the included templates (see above),
the actual template path loaded is subject to a language-specific selection.

If e.g. "templates/aton/light-character.ftl" is loaded in the context of a Danish locale,
then the actual template being loaded is the "templates/aton/light-character_da.ftl" template
(if it exists).

==== Dictionaries in Freemarker Templates

As described in the <<Dictionaries>> chapter, dictionaries are also used in Freemarker Templates.
As an example, the "message" and "mail" dictionaries are available to mailing-list Freemarker
templates, the "message" and "pdf" are available to print report Freemarker templates, and so
forth. The following examples demonstrate how to emit a dictionary term:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Emitting the "pdf.toc" dictionary entry -->
<h2>${text("pdf.toc")}</h2>

<!-- Emitting a parameterized dictionary entry which contains a {0} placeholder -->
${text('cancellation.this_message',cancelDate)}
----

=== Intermediate Message Template Format

Freemarker templates are used for generating an intermediate XML-based _Message Template Format_.
Message templates are used so extensively, that the format merits its own description below.
Please also refer to the <<Categories>> and
http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
chapters.

The data passed along to the Freemarker template being executed is

[ cols="30,70", options="header" ]
|===
| Data
| Description

| message
| A template NW or NM message instantiated from input fields in the template execution dialog.

| params
| A map of other parameters instantiated from input fields in the template execution dialog.

| template
| The message template (executable category) being executed.

| languages
| The list of model languages to generate data for.

|===

The output of the Freemarker templates should be an intermediate XML format, which contain a list
of <field-template> elements for each field that should be updated of the message.
The snippet below illustrates what the resulting XML may look like:

[source,xml]
----
<field-template field="part.getDesc('en').subject" format="text">
    Denmark. Kattegat. Randers Fiord. Light unlit.
</field-template>

<field-template field="part.getDesc('da').subject" format="text">
    Danmark. Kattegat. Randers Fjord. Fyr slukket.
</field-template>

<field-template field="part.getDesc('en').details" format="html">
    <p>The light Voer Brohoved in pos. 56&deg; 31.2'N - 010&deg; 13.8'E is unlit.</p>
</field-template>

<field-template field="part.getDesc('da').details" format="html">
    <p>Fyret Voer Brohoved p&aring; pos. 56&deg; 31,2'N - 010&deg; 13,8'E er slukket.</p>
</field-template>

<field-template field="message.promulgation('audio').text" update="append">
    Fyret Voer Brohoved på position 56 grader 31,2 min. nord 10 grader 13,8 min. øst er slukket.
</field-template>

<field-template field="message.promulgation('navtex').text" update="append">
    LIGHT VOER BROHOVED 56-31.2N 010-13.8E
    UNLIT.
</field-template>
----

The "field" attribute (which is actually a JavaScript expression), is used to point out
which message attribute to update with the contents of the <field-template>.

The "update" attribute indicates whether to replace or append the content to the attribute.

The "format" attribute indicates the format of the <field-template> contents. If the format is e.g.
"text", then the contents is cleaned up as a single line of text.

Unlike most other types of script resources, which gets instantiated with a specific language and
locale, the ones used for message templates should handle multiple languages themselves.
The currently used language can be changed using the following snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<#setting locale='da'>
----

=== Adding or Editing a Script Resource

The sysadmin can add a new Freemarker Template or JavaScript file by clicking the "Add Script Resource"
button, and select the type to add:

image::ScriptResourcesAddBtn.png[Add Script Resource Button, 120]

Similarly, the sysadmin may edit an existing script resource by clicking the pencil icon next to the
script resource.

The editor for the script being added or edited, contains two fields; the script resource path and
the actual script:

image::ScriptResourceEditor.png[Script Resource Editor, 500]

The script editor has syntax coloring to aid and facilitate the editing process.

=== Script Resource Revisions

Script resources are versioned, in the sense that every time the sysadmin edits and saves a script
resource, a new revision is stored.
The revisions of a script resource can be inspected by clicking the "History" button, which opens the
_Script Resource History_ dialog:

image::ScriptResourceHistory.png[Script Resource History Dialog, 500]

An earlier revision of the script can be inspected by clicking the checkbox next to the revision.
If two revisions are selected (as above), the dialog will display the differences using color coding.

=== Deleting a Script Resource

A script resource can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.
However, the sysadmin should first carefully check if the script resource is referenced in mailing lists,
print reports, message templates, or indeed included in other script resources.

=== Reloading Script Resources

As described in the <<Script Resource Extensions>> chapter, script resources may originate from files
in the Niord class-path, before being loaded into the database.
Any subsequent changes to a script resources will (naturally) only update the version in the database,
which may thus come out of sync with the class-path file.

If the sysadmin enacts the "Reload files" function from the action menu, all script resources in the
database will be overridden with any corresponding version in the class-path.

=== Importing and Exporting Script Resource

The system administrator can export and import script resources from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-core/src/main/java/org/niord/core/script/vo/ScriptResourceVo.java[ScriptResourceVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "content": "\n<#macro formatLightCharacterPhase phase multiple=false >\n   ...",
    "path": "templates/aton/light-character.ftl",
    "type": "FM"
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing a script resource JSON file will trigger the _script-resource-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a script resource import JSON file on the _Script Resource_
sysadmin page, the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/script-resource-import/in_ folder.
