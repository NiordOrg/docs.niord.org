== Keycloak Integration

Keycloak is an open source identity and access management middleware product, which is documented
in detail at the http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak website].

In general, once Niord has been set up and configured, there is hardly any need for administrators
to use Keycloak directly.

Keycloak has been integrated tightly with Niord in the manner detailed below. The reader should be
somewhat familiar with Keycloak before reading this.

=== Niord Domains

Domains in Niord are detailed in the <<Domains>> chapter.
For each domain in Niord, there will be _bearer only_ application client in Keycloak.

image::KeycloakClients.png[Keycloak Clients, 600]

As an example, for the "NM" Niord domain, there is a corresponding "niord-nm" application client
in Keycloak.

Also, there is a single _public_ application client for the actual Niord web application.

==== Roles ====

As described in the <<System Administrators Manual>> chapter, a user may have either the _User_,
_Editor_, _Admin_ or _Sysadmin_ role in each of the Niord domains.

These roles area really just _application client roles_ in Keycloak:

image::KeycloakClientRoles.png[Keycloak Client Roles, 600]

The roles are _composite_ client roles, defined hierarchically, so that if a user has the _Sysadmin_
role, she also automatically has the _Admin_ role, if she has the _Admin_ roles, she also automatically
has the _Editor_ role, and if she has the _Editor_ role, she also automatically has the _User_ role.


When a domain is created via the Niord UI, the corresponding application client, including the client
roles mentioned above, are created automatically in Keycloak.

=== Niord Users

All users in Niord are created and maintained in Keycloak, although Niord also provides a UI for
managing users on top of Keycloak, as detailed in the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#users-contacts[Users & Contacts] chapter of the
administrator guide.

In turn, Keycloak may be configured to use other identity providers.
For instance, in the set-up used by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA), Keycloak is integrated with the
_DMA Active Directory Federation Service_, and hence, the first time a DMA employee clicks the "DMA" link
on the log-in page and logs in using her usual work credentials, she will automatically be created as
a user in Keycloak.

Keycloak can also be integrated with other Keycloak services, Active Directory or other LDAP provides, etc.

==== User Groups

Instead of assigning domain roles (i.e. Keycloak application client roles) directly to users, which would
be a tedious task, Niord instead rely on Keycloak _Groups_.

As an example, at the Danish Maritime Authority, the following user groups are defined,
at the time of writing:

* _Sysadmin_: Members of the "Sysadmin" user group will have the _Sysadmin_ role in all domains.
* _Admins_: Members of the "Admins" user group will have the _Admin_ role in all domains.
* _Editors_: Members of the "Editor" user group will have the _Editor_ role in the "NW", "NM", "Firing Areas",
  "NM Almanac", "NM Annex" and "NW Greenland" domains.
* _Case Officers_: Members of the "Case Officers" user group will have the _User_ role the "NW", "NM", "Firing Areas",
  "NM Almanac", "NM Annex" and "NW Greenland" domains.
* _FE Editors_: Members of the "FE Editors" user group will have the _Editor_ role in the "Firing Areas" domain.

These groups are defined and maintained in Keycloak:

For each group, the relevant domain roles are assigned, as in the example below, where the
"Editors" group is assigned the "editor" role of the "niord-nm" application client (i.e. "NM" domain):

image::KeycloakGroupRoles.png[Keycloak Group Roles, 600]

Groups are created and maintained quite rarely. However, assigning users to groups is a common
everyday task for administrators.
Hence, Niord provides a simplified UI for this task, as detailed in the
http://docs.niord.org/admin-manual/manual.html#managing-user-group-membership[Managing User Group Memebership]
chapter.

=== User-Specific Editor-Fields

The list of editor fields being displayed when a user edits a message in Niord is highly configurable.
There are settings to define a base set of fields, a message main-type (NW,NM) specific set,
plus the list can be customized depending on the message series, areas and categories assigned
to the message.

It is also possible to customize the list of editor fields per user in Keycloak, or indeed, per user
group.

Step 1 is for the system administrator to define two _User Attribute Mappers_ for the "niord-web"
application client; one for the "editorFieldsNw" _token claim_ and one for the "editorFieldsNm"
_token claim_. Example:

image::KeycloakClientMapper.png[Keycloak Client Mapper, 600]

Step 2 is for the system administrator to assign the relevant "editorFieldsNw" and "editorFieldsNm"
user attributes either directly to the user, or - more likely - to the relevant user groups.
The format of the attribute values should be a JSON structure that enables and disables specific
editor fields. Example:

image::KeycloakGroupAttribute.png[Keycloak Group Attribute, 600]

=== Niord Security

All access to the Niord backend happens via calls to REST endpoints. The obvious example is the
actual Niord web application which makes Ajax calls to the Niord backend.

The Niord backend has been integrated with Keycloak, so that all calls to Niord resolves the
roles of the callee in the context of the current domain
(the current domain is specified via a request header).

Hence, access to Niord can be checked using standard Java EE security checks.
See the (simplified) example below, where annotating a REST endpoint with "@RolesAllowed(Roles.ADMIN)"
will validate that the user has the _Admin_ role in the current domain, or throw an exception.
