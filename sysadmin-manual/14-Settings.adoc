== Settings

The _Settings_ page allows a system administrator to manage system settings in Niord.

image::SettingsPage.png[Settings, 800]

Settings are ultimately persisted to the database, and this is the incarnation of the settings that you
get to view and modify on the _Settings_ page.

However, the settings originate from various sources before being persisted to the database. These options
are detailed later in this chapter.

=== Settings Model

A setting in Niord is more that just a key-value pair. It is comprised of the following attributes:

[ cols="20,80", options="header" ]
|===
| Setting Attribute
| Description

| Key
| A unique key for the setting.

| Value
| The _value_ of the setting. The format of the value depends on the _type_ of the setting.

| Type
| The _type_ of a setting can be one of "String", "Password", "Integer", "Long", "Float", "Double",
  "Date", "Boolean", "Path" and "json".

| Description
| A textual description of the setting.

| Cached
| Dictates if the setting may be cached (for a few minutes) in Niord. This reduces load on the database.

| Web
| If this flag is set, the setting is passed along to the Niord web-application via a JavaScript
  file, and becomes available to the Angular code as a $rootScope variable.

| Editable
| If this flag is set, the setting is editable and included in the settings list on the _Settings_ page.

|===

Note that for settings of type "Password", the associated value _never_ leaves the Niord backend.
If the _Editable_ flag is set, the sysadmin can set a new password on the _Settings_ page, but she can never
view the old password.

=== Settings from niord.json

Whenever Niord starts up, it will look for a "niord.json" file in Niords home folder (itself
controlled with a settings).

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "key"         : "baseUri",
    "description" : "The base application server URI",
    "value"       : "https://niord.e-navigation.net",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
  },
  {
    "key"         : "authServerUrl",
    "description" : "The Keycloak URL",
    "value"       : "https://niord-keycloak.e-navigation.net/auth",
    "web"         : false,
    "editable"    : true
  },
  ...
]
----

=== Settings from Environment Variables

When the Niord application server (Wildfly) starts up, settings may be instantiated using
environment variables.

Example: In order to specify the "niord.home" system setting, instantiate Wildfly with the argument
"-Dniord.home=/home/enav/niord".

If settings are defined from environment variables, they are essentially read-only. A sysadmin
cannot override these settings on the _Settings_ page.

=== Settings from Code

Settings can also be defined and instantiated with default values directly in Niord java code.

Example:
[source,java]
----
public class RepositoryService {

    @Inject
    @Setting(value="repoRootPath", defaultValue="${niord.home}/repo",
             description="The root directory of the Niord repository")
    Path repoRoot;

    @Inject
    @Setting(value="repoCacheTimeout", defaultValue="5",
             description="Cache timeout of repo files in minutes", type=Type.Integer)
    Integer cacheTimeout;

    ...
}
----


=== Editing a System Setting

The sysadmin can edit a system setting by clicking the pencil symbol next to the setting.

This will open the _Setting Editor Page_:

image::SettingEditPage.png[Setting Editor Page, 500]

The only setting attribute that can be edited is the _value_ of the setting.
The editor widget used for editing the value depends on the _type_ of the setting, with checkboxes used
for "boolean" settings, a date picker used for settings of type "Date", etc.

=== Importing and Exporting Settings

The system administrator can export and import system settings from the action menu.

The export/import file format is based on a JSON representation of the
https://github.com/NiordOrg/niord/blob/master/niord-web/src/main/java/org/niord/web/SettingsRestService.java[SettingVo]
class.

Example:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "description": "The Keycloak URL",
    "key": "authServerUrl",
    "type": "String",
    "value": "https://localhost-kc.e-navigation.net/auth"
  },
  {
    "description": "The base application server URI",
    "key": "baseUri",
    "type": "String",
    "value": "https://localhost.e-navigation.net"
  },
  ...
]
----

Importing a settings JSON file will trigger the _settings-import_ batch job.
Batch jobs can be monitored and managed by system administrators.

As an alternative to manually uploading a settings import JSON file on the _Settings_ sysadmin page,
the file can be copied to the _$NIORD_HOME/batch-jobs/settings-import/in_ folder.
