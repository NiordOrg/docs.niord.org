The _Sysadmin_ page of Niord only become available if you log in as a system administrator.

The _Sysadmin_ page allows system administrators to manage and configure the Niord system.

In general a user that is system administrator in one domain should be system administrator
in all domains, since all the setup and configuration they can manage on the Sysadmin pages
applies to all domains.
