== Domains

The _Domains_ page allows a system administrator to manage the list of domains in Niord.

As described in the <<System Administrators Manual>> section, a Niord user always works in the context
of a _current domain_.
Domains are used to separate NW & NM messages into more manageable lists -
such as a specific domain for NW messages, a domain for NM messages, a domain
for firing exercises (also NWs), or indeed domains for separate regions with
separate time-zones, etc.

Domains also plays a central role in <<Keycloak Integration>>. Each domain is created as an
application client in Keycloak.

The sysadmin may filter the list of domains by typing a term into the _Filter_ input field above the
domain list. The term is matched against the ID and name of the domains.

=== Adding or Editing a Domain

The sysadmin can add a new domain by clicking the "New domain" button, or edit an existing
domain by clicking the pencil symbol next to the domain.

This will open the _Domain Edit Page_:

The domains attributes:

|===
| Domain Attribute
| Description

| Keycloak ID
| A unique ID for the domain. The ID is also used as an application client in Keycloak.

| Active
| Only active domains is available in the domain selector in the main menu of Niord.

| Sort Order
| The domain sort order. Controls the order of the domains in the domain menu.

| Keycloak Status
| If the corresponding Keycloak client does not exist in Keycloak, there will be a button to create
  it.

| Name
| The human readable name of the domain.

| Time Zone
| The time-zone of the domain. The domain time zone will be used at various placed where the
  editor specifies dates, such as the publication dates of a message.

| Map Center
| Optionally, a map center and zoom level can be specified. This will be used whenever a map is opened
  with empty contents, such as when opening the
  http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#position-editor[Position Editor].

| Message Sort Order
| The default sort order of messages in the domain. The sort order may be either by message area, ID or
  event dates, in ascending or descending order.

| HTML Color
| If an HTML color is defined for the message, this color will be displayed in the main menu of Niord
  when the domain is the currently selected domain.
  Any valid HTML color code can be used, such as "red", "#ff0000", etc.

| Areas
| The _Areas_ field can be used to restrict the areas that may be assigned to messages of that domain.
  If e.g. "Denmark" is selected, then only "Denmark" or any of the sub-areas of "Denmark" can be
  assigned to a message of that domain.

| Categories
| The _Categories_ field can be used to restrict the categories that may be assigned to messages of that domain.
  If e.g. "Firing Exercises" is selected, then only "Firing Exercises" or any of the sub-categories of
  "Firing Exercises" can be assigned to a message of that domain.

| Message Series
| The _Message Series_ field must define the valid message series to use in the domain.

| Publish
| If the _Publish_ flag is checked, then the messages of the domain is included by default, when using
  the public Niord REST API to fetch messages. In effect, this means that third party clients will
  receive messages of the domain by default.

| AtoNs
| If the _AtoNs_ flag is checked, then the "AtoN" domain will be turned on when the domain is the
  currently selected domain.
  The AtoN module is a prototype module, that integrates an AtoN registry with Niord.
  Since it is not complete, it is not yet documented, and not turned on by default.

| Templates
| If the _Templates_ flag is checked, then the message template mechanism described in the
  http://docs.niord.org/editor-manual/manual.html#message-template-execution[Message Template Execution]
  chapter will be enabled.

=== Deleting a Domain

A domain can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to them.
However, this only works if there is not related data associated with the domain.

Instead the system administrator can choose to in-activate the domain.
